There is a large area in front of the gate where many people congregate and take photos. The gateway is very large and has some information about the history. There are a few other monuments nearby, including the Taj Mahal Palace.There is only one entrance to the area which requires bag screening and searches, usually when it's not too busy. It is free to enter the place. There are food stalls located outside the main entrance which sell a variety of different street food. It does get really busy though, since the area also has terminals for many ferries around the area including Elephanta. It was particularly busy on Sunday where the traffic was very heavy along the area. It is a nice place to make a day of since there are plenty of other attraction and sites around here.",0.8442,5

As part of the Tata Mumbai Marathon, there was a show going on at the Gateway that got the whole area filled with a serenade of Indian classical music and beats which made it truly a magical experience.

It was very busy (late Sunday afternoon as sunset approached)Unfortunately the views across the water were interrupted by smog. The stench from the water as the tide was going out was a bit much.. hidden only by the traffic pollution.It would be a really nice walk if it wasn't for the above. There are people everywhere and the atmosphere is good. I'm sure on a clearer day the view would be worth it.We took a stroll.. people will approach you to take your photo as you walk along..we just politely said no.. but some people still tried and secretly tried to take our photo.

Tobacco spit inscriptions can be found in many places meant for sitting. This is the biggest con.

Bandra_Worli_Sea_Link,Asad Khan,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020 • Family,Fantastic but Expensive,A much-needed bridge that reduces the travel time between Bandra and Worli significantly while giving the megacity a revamped look to show-off and be proud of. The driving experience on the bridge always feels good and luckily it has been maintained unlike the rest of the city. The unfortunate thing is that it charges travellers toll even when the citizens have paid ample of road tax and because the toll charge is expensive and continues to increase a lot of people don't access the bridge and so doesn't fulfil the objective of its construction.,0.836,5

Bandra_Worli_Sea_Link,Sagar M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Couples,Smooth and scenic. Expensive though.,"State of the art bridge with smooth, well marked roads and vehicles observing lane discipline. Drastically reduces time to go from Worli to Bandra. In effect, does the job it was meant to do.The views are scenic, but be careful if you are driving. Don't get distracted. Speeding is not common so its relatively safe. Prices are steep though. Monthly pass is surprisingly more expensive than monthly sum of daily toll. However, high prices keep out traffic and what you get is a fast, smooth, safe and scenic drive. Pro Tip: One fine evening, take your date along, roll down the windows and enjoy the short drive with some great music. Keep your eyes on the road though. The views are for your partner only.",0.9825,5

The veg restaurant outside the temple is good for food. Chappal stand is free but will be available only another devotee returns their chappals. Have to wait in line. Prasad counters are spread across and so are teeth prasad counters. Free laddu prasad is set up outside the main temple and people coming out of the temple or people already outside can stand in line to collect, which is tedious.

As we walked out people came to crowd us to buy flowers and leave your shoes it was not a nice experience.We walked in and same thing all the flower vendors come to you to go to their stall to buy. We went to the queue which was very long (we went on a sat) and it was too hot to stand outside. So we decided to do Darshan from far, it was absolutely manic in front people in crowds pushing and shoving to see Lord Ganesh for a second and be pushed forward. You could go through the fast track but again it’s all to do with money and I don’t agree that going to a temple you have to pay at every point you go to. This was not our idea of a peaceful time at a temple and I wouldn’t recommend it we were out within 15 minutes. There are many beautiful temples in India to visit without this hassle.",0.9304,5

Sign boards inside the temple could be better. Close up darshan is at the back side of the temple but doordarshan is at the entrance so people (first timers) get confused. Flower stalls are a loot. Overall the display of idol is vast/wide and view to the devotees is good. Rush is a huge thing though. Photography is not allowed so no pics. Veg restaurant outside temple is good for food. Chappal stand is free but will be available only another devotee returns for their chappals. Have to wait in line. Prasad counters are spread across and so are teerth prasad counters. Free laddu prasad is set up outside the main temple and people coming out of the temple or people already outside, both can stand in line to collect, which is tedious. Laddu prasad can be directly provided inside the temple premise so that people need not stand in line.

Chhatrapati_Shivaji_Terminus,Jaideelion,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,"Access, service and control","The terminus is very busy and also not very managed. Morning traffic to arrive the terminal is so bad that people have to get off about half a km off and pull their bags to the station and then to the platform. There are no directions to the platforms or an information screen to tell the travellers which train goes where. The only people who seem to know all are porters who start by asking 500 rupees for any platform. Then negotiation starts. The figure stipulated by the IR is 200 rupees. Imagine is a porter gets 5 customers a day. Thats 1000 rupees and about 30,000 rupees a month. That is a hell a lot of money for porterage for about five minutes a trip. There must be a payment back to IR officials. The system can be improved a lot but will not be done. At 6 am on 30th November 2019, there was only one xray machine working and no control as to whose bag was loaded. People were jumping over us to load their own bags first. Just imagine the chaos where 10000s of pax are getting late for their trains. The system can be stream lined by not allowing any vehicle inside the terminus and all drop off on the left side of the Road and vehicles to keep moving, but it will not happen.So advice to all travellers, arrive early not by your standards but by Indian standards, push yourself in front of bossy pax and most importantly, get a poter. Pay 200 rupees and just follow him. A well spent 200 rupees.",-0.8795,1

Since children has varied interest, they have tried including as much as possible for everyone to find something of their interest or can explore something they have never done before. The best bit is that the children gets to understand the concept of earning the money and then spending it on the things/activity they like (just like the real life) , even saving so that they can do something that interest them more. Is not this amazing? The food is amazing, and they do have very kid friendly menu too.

Kids learn lots of things.. the concept educate the kids the value of money as they first earn the money by doing hard work like Masion Man, Fire Fighter, Tiffin wala and courier man, thereafter only they manage to spend on. It clearly gives them how money is being earned and how much to spend and dave too. Food was also brilliant, its a must visit place. Even with kids parents will also enjoy.",0.9779,5

The set up they have created covers so many practical professions (like Fire Fighter, Dabbawala, Dentist), Making process of Brands like Frooti, Laughing Cow Cheese, kinderjoy. They have arts, craft, painting activities. Separate playhouse with Puzzles & games for 2-4 yr olds. Kids drive this city where they earn & spend in Kidzo currency. I liked the concept of Kidzania. Kids learn about managing money, take up responsibilities & get to perform lot of fun activities independently. They have a separate parents lounge. However we didn't opt for it as we wanted to spend family time. Good food, Clean City, Plenty of Washrooms. All in all a good experience.",0.967,5

The place is full of interactive and learning games, which help the kids in learning with fun!

A few games cost KidZo cash and there are games where kids can earn KidZo! • There's a mock city inside, well thought and beautiful. This enables a kid to experience, just like real life! • There are also good food cafes inside. I would highly recommend this place for every kid!",0.9823,5

KidZania_Mumbai,Mayura Amarkant,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022 • Family,Lovely kids area,"Visited with my 6 yrs old kid and he enjoyed a lot there. A must visit place for the kids with age around 5 yrs to 10 yrs.Few tips for the persons visiting Kidzania :1. Book for the full day pass. You will get tired but your kids will surely enjoy whole day.2. Try to go early morning by 10 AM. Early morning it's less rush and you can complete the major activities by noon time.3. Parents can make revisits. But an adult should be present with kid below 8 yr. Kids are not allowed to make re-entries.4. Food over here is little bit pricy. Like Pav Bhaji, Chole Bhature around 200, Sada Dosa around 160. Which is quite ok.5. Kids will get multiple food item to eat which they prepare during activities. Like Pizza Slice, Donut, Kinder Joy, Nutella Sandwich, Parle G biscuit.6. Here they give kids cash in form of Kidzos which kids needs to manage.I suggest to keep cash with Kids instead of debit card as they will learn counting the cash amount.7. There are few activities which requires to spend Kidzos and few activities where kids will earn Kidzos. Please note that activities and try to do activities based on that so that you won't run out of money.8. Don't involve kids only in earnings. The gifts they give from the remaining Kidzos are quite ok types. Instead ask them also to involve in sending activities. We saw few kids only doing activities to earn Kidzos. I feel there should be balance.9. Few activities like burger making are closed.10. Do visit the maps online if you are visiting for the first time.11. Certain activities are age specific. Like car driving session and others have height restrictions. Amity University u can visit if above 812. Few activities can be done with parents like RJ. 13. They don't allow parents to enter activity areas as they wants kids to take the decisions and participate.Overall a good place to enjoy with your kid. They actually learn while playing. They treat each kid with respect calling them Sir and Madam which is really appreciated.",0.9964,5

At Kidzania, children are at the epicentre of everything and that is why the kids had a BLAST!! They got an opportunity to play fire women, doctors, policewomen, reality show participants, dubbing artistes, and even manufacturers of sweets and beverages! There's a saying that goes:Tell me and I will forget,Teach me and I will remember,INVOLVE me and I will understand!!Kidzania is a perfect example of immersive, experiential learning for kids.I was so happy to meet my former teacher and current mentor of Top Scholars, Dr. Sanjay Salunkhe.

The space is amazing, the hygiene is too good.The activities created are age appropriate and gives them a great exposure about different professions that exists and makes the child feel to try atleAst once that particular profession. The concept of not letting the parents allow is something really appreciable as the child learns to listen to what a particular person needs to say regarding that profession.

Be it shopping, sight seeing , restaurant hopping or a mix of all these(which is usually do) , be it anything! You can spend an entire day roaming around this place. When I visited Colaba in 2013(college time), we visited every single shop in the Colaba market looking out for the best of the best available here. Frankly speaking, I got some best stuff at best rates(even at Rs 50) which I still use. If you have time to go through the shops and bargain with the shopkeepers, then Colaba market is one place you shouldn't miss in your shopping list. Second time we visited this place, we did some sight seeing and tried to make some memories. You can enjoy the best sights of Taj Mumbai and Gateway of India in Colaba. (I recommend going here in the morning to get the best experience because it becomes too crowded in the evening ). Coming to food, we have been to Leopold's cafe(yum food + the popularity of being attacked by terrorists in 2008 makes it a must visit place) and Delhi Durbar which servers some average Mughalai and North Indian stuff(the interiors are done like a typical Indian restaurant). Altogether, Colaba is one of the best  places in Mumbai to spend a day with friends, be it walking through the streets or getting some food !! It gives a pleasant experience for tourists.

Elephanta_Caves,Acineto,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,Interesting History,"The boat to Elephanta is located directly behind the Gateway of India in Colaba. I brought my ticket in line while waiting for the boat. I came quite early on a Sunday morning (0930) so it wasn't too busy at the wharf or on the island. The boat ride was interesting as people were feeding the gulls but was quite long, about an hour.A wasn't planning on getting a guide when I arrived but one latched onto me. It cost 3000 rupees for the tour. The entry into the village and into the caves was on top of that, about 600 Rupees total. There is a toilet in the village which also was paid.I probably would have enjoyed walking around by myself to explore the island without the guide. However, having him there was interesting since I was able to learn about the history of the island and the caves. I was also able to learn more about the culture and the meanings of the different carvings inside the cave. There are monkeys on the island so be wary in case they snatch things from you. I also did learn that they close on Mondays to that the island villagers are able to stock up for the week. I was also informed that it is less busy during the weekdays.The village area has plenty of souvenir stalls as well as restaurants. They are present from the wharf to the top of the caves area so there are plenty of opportunities for both. They were a bit sketchy with lunch though since I ended up paying for lunch for myself and my guide without prior knowledge. The place did get really crowded as I left. The wharf area was packed so it was a little difficult getting around. I did try the train on the way back to the boat, which was a novelty. Be aware that there are two companies that work the boats, show your ticket to the people in charge so that you return to the right place.Overall it was an interesting way to spend half a day learning about the history and culture of the area. It could potentially be a day trip if you were planning on exploring the whole island and having a picnic.",0.964,5

The other ones are mixture of good to plain. Near the cave entrance, there is a Cannon Hill point which is a plain hike offering little sceneries under a hot sun (even in the early morning).I also took an off-the-beaten hike through one of the mountains towards Cave 6, which again offers no meaningful reliefs with poorly-maintained pathways.Seeing that it took 1 hour per way to get there, I am not thrilled with the overall experience. I am glad I went there to tick off another UNESCO World Heritage Site, but I am not planning to return a second time.",0.7187,5
Elephanta_Caves,Apolonia70,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,"Ferry boat, mini-train and 120 steps to fisrt cave","The main reason I scored average for this tour was that it needs endurance to do this tour.  We arrived at the ferryboat to be told there was a delay.  My guide did some negotiating and managed to get us on board the first ferry to depart. It was delayed because security was tight - some dignitary was visiting the island. We were the only ferry boat to depart until after another 1.5 hrs. Lucky.  The ferry trip is good because you get great views back to the city - Gateway to India and the Taj hotel and city skyline. Lots of small boats add colour. There are also large commercial ships, tug boats and the Indian navy.  A massive oil refinery and pipelines stretch out to sea as is the newly being constructed highway system joining another part of the mainland.  It is impossibly long. Once you reach the island and disembark at the jetty - you have the option to walk or ride the mini-train. Hot and humid so the train a logical choice. Endurance is needed to reach the caves - 120 steps of various height and surface demand constant focus and persistence. it would have been less arduous if there was better airflow. The stall keepers had erected blue plastic shades over their stall and the steps so it made things even hotter and more steamy. I was determined to climb all steps and refused offers to be carried up in a 2-4 man sedan chair.  I did climb up and down all of them.  The first main cave is an example of religious figures telling the story of Shiva and other gods/ goddesses. It was cooler in the cave and not too many tourists. I dint visit the other caves or areas - by then I was too dehydrated. Thankfully a stall was selling fresh lime soda and I drank 2 glasses.  This visit was tough for me at over 70yrs of age - so perhaps for younger and more able persons this would not have been their experience. Basically - I am glad I visited and even if you have seem other similar sites - there is always something new to learn. If nothing else the photo ops from the boat make it worthwhile.",0.9616,5

From the jetty, had to walk about a kilometre and climb up a considerable number of steps to reach the caves. Though much of the carvings have been destroyed with the course of time and maybe also by invaders as these carvings depict Shiva/nataraj, the remnants speak of the rich culture and heritage of India. Quite a touristy place where the road is lined with shops selling street food and souvenirs. While on our return journey to the jetty, we took the quaint toy train and the journey was fun as the small carriages rattled their way amidst the bay water on both sides. The whole day was a bit tiring but it was indeed much fun. Visitors to Mumbai should not miss this place.By the way, all basic facilities are available at this spot.

This ended up being my favourite day of our whole trip! The caves were amazing and the statue carvings are incredible! I would highly recommend using a tour guide as there are no explanations or information boards once you go in. We got the ferry from The Gateway of India and were met by Chandrakant at the other side. I wasn't looking for a tour guide, but I immediately got a good vibe from him and took his offer of showing us around. It only cost £14 for both me and my partner and it was worth every penny. He took us through the crowds and past the busy shops, then he enthusiastically explained all the history of the caves. He also helped us jump the queue for buying tickets which was great. After that, he walked us to his village on the island, a really unique experience which was only 10 minutes away. He made us tea and we chatted about all sorts of things! We also met his daughter. Later, he walked us back to the main area and showed us a great place to eat! I cannot recommend this tour enough. A real authentic and once in a lifetime experience.

Elephanta_Caves,Maria Ligaya,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,"This site is filled with maltreatment and abuse of stray dogs, which turns me off.","It was a nice day out for the family, we learnt about its history, and there are areas to relax and have a picnic. HOWEVER, what truly turned me off about this site was the maltreatment of the stray dogs by the Guards and locals.There are an alarming amount of stray dogs in this area, and many are in critical condition. Malnourished and dehydrated, the majority are skin and bones. I realise that not everyone likes dogs, but the absolute least they should do is leave them alone. The only reason they become hostile is because they have been mistreated and abused by humans. They will return in kind if you leave them alone and respect their space. The guards, on the other hand, are beating them with sticks and starving them to death. If you are concerned about the impact of the stray on your guests, I recommend contacting a Mumbai Animal Shelter, the Bombay Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, or one of the other organisations that may help. This type of situation bothers me and makes me uncomfortable.  You might also simply give them food or water. You may bring them some inexpensive cookies to feed them. When a location and its inhabitants are harsh to stray animals, it has a negative and psychological impact on certain tourists, turning them off.",-0.9739,1
Elephanta_Caves,Wilson Miller,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2022,Visit the caves and local villages,"Overall, Elephanta Island is well worth a visit on a first trip to Bombay. As compared to the bustle of the city, the island and its scenery are serene. The ferry from the Gateway of India is pleasant, with views of the harbor and many cargo ships, though not spectacular. Upon arrival, the path to the caves ascends a number of steps lined with vendors hawking souvenirs -- a bit tacky for my taste but expected at any popular tourist attraction. The caves themselves are interesting, well-kept, and beautifully set. Though I did not partake, a guide may be worthwhile to learn about the caves' religious iconography and history.The caves themselves take little time to explore; however, while on Elephanta, it is also possible to follow a path to three villages -- Shentbandar, Morabandar, and Rajbandar -- around the outskirts of the island. I initially intended to visit myself, but ultimately hired a local man I met along the way as a guide. The villages are largely untouched by the nearby tourists (though many of the residents work at the caves or the nearby container port), so a visit provides an interesting case study in the tensions between industrial development and traditional livelihoods. Well worth a visit for those keen to escape the tourists and learn a bit about the people on whom the operation of the attraction relies.",0.9908,5

It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the cave temples predominantly dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva. The caves nicely depict the Indian culture and ancient architectural techniques, though mostly depleted. It is around one-hour boat ride from Mumbai dock / Gateway of India to the Island. The return fare of boat ride is Rs. 205 per head. The boat ride was a refreshing experience with cool breeze and watching seagulls flying pretty close or quietly floating on the water. Once reached the Island, there is an option of toy train @ 10 per head or walk to reach the main attractions, there is a fee of Rs. 5 per head to enter the site.  There is around 120 steep steps leading to the cave, several small stalls selling different souvenir items and  tiny restaurants are lined-up on both side of the stairs.  The climb may be tedious however, if require, one can take rest in between to regain the breathing. The entry fee in the caves temple is Rs. 40 per head. The cave temples are associated with some interesting ancient history and to know the same, hiring a local guide @ Rs. 500 is recommended. The Elephanta Caves contain rock cut stone sculptures of Lord Shiva and Hindu mythology, however most of the artwork is defaced and damaged by the Portuguese soldiers. Presently,  it is maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India to prevent further damage to the caves. Beware of monkeys and avoid carrying food stuff to avert encounter with them.

It means, in a visit to Elephanta caves you can cover Gateway of India, The Taj Mahal Hotel, and many places nearby. You can find a lot of foreigners visiting the caves. There are plenty of shops selling souvenirs, foods, and other refreshments on the way to the caves after reaching the island.Stone carvings, the entire architecture is interesting too.Preferred season and timing: The trip is going to be sultry in summers. I wouldn't recommend the peak summer months. Plan in the morning and it is not recommended to visit if you are starting from 'Gateway of India' around 4 pm, the caves could get closed by the time you travel on a boat and climb up to the caves.Though I wanted to give a 5 star, I reduced one star because of the dirty water during the boat journey.",-0.7784,1

But now, it is Rs. 40 per Indian and Rs. 600 per foreigner. There are restaurants nearby. There are small shops lined on the steps. One can walk or ride on a toy train to reach the foothill. It takes an hour to reach the island by ferry from the Gateway of India.These caves are an ideal place for families as well as history lovers. It is a must visit and should not be missed.",0.9352,5

Elephanta_Caves,MWandAW,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,Cave temples predominantly dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva,"My wife and I visited the Elephanta Caves as part of a guided tour of Mumbai. Not limestone caves, but a stone construction that was dug out and sculptured from the top down. The caves are hewn from solid basalt rock. That is amazing work and is truly mind blowing to think that the artisans did that. The caves were named Elefante by the colonial Portuguese, when they found elephant statues on it. According to Archaeological Survey of India and UNESCO, the site was settled in ancient times and the cave temples were built between 5th and 6th century. Knowing that, it is worth the 1 hour boat ride each way, the 10 minute mini-train journey and the 15 minute walk up the 120 steps to the cave entrance. Our Chartered Boat was the first to arrive at the island that the morning. Arriving first meant that all of the stalls on the steps weren't set up yet and we were the first people into the caves. Our guide spoke quite loudly and I was able to hear what she was saying as I ran around and snapped my pictures without anyone in them. We had a good hour before anyone else arrived. We are glad we went and it showed us a different aspect of Hindu history of the area. We think that the visit was entirely worth the cost, the energy and the time to get there.",0.9806,5
Elephanta_Caves,Jayan,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,Must visit but if healthy.,"You can reach Elephanta cave by boat from Gate way of India. You have to take ticket to board the boat from Gate way of India. Both tourism dept boat and private operated boat are available. But I think the cheap rated Govt boat service are not functioning properly to boost so called ,'luxury boat'. Nothing luxury in it. You have to pay extra (now Rs.20) to sit on the deck. Deck may be or may not be covered. Nothing worthy in sitting in hot sun or in rain there. The seats may be dirty due birds  excreta. Boat will take minimum one hour to reach the island. If weather is bad, some people's may feel little sick while oscillating in waves. Better avoid heavy spicy food. At Island first you have to take a ticket to enter the village. Then another ticket to enter the cave. Both are very cheap. The cave on a hill top. A toy train available. But, it will took you to hill bottom only and children only can enjoy the drive. It is better to walk. Less than hundred steps is to be covered to reach the top. It is a group of ancient caves. Almost all are perished. But even now you can feel the greatness.  Due to limit of time we could not visit the other side of hill.  About two hours required to round all the places.  Some snack bar a small hotel available there.

There are a number of caves but most of the carvings are in one of the caves.  It's actually quite an open space and not like going down into a cave with stalactites and the like.The carvings have had some damage over the years but are impressive in size and detail.  Most are dedicated to the god Shiva.  We had a guide with us who helped bring the carvings to life with her detailed stories.As mentioned, the boat trip takes about an hour.  Then you can walk to the start of some steps or take a small train which is fun.  Then you're faced with a climb of some 120 or so steps but with lots of non-step areas also on the way.  Our tour group had a woman with bad knees and she made it.  There is an option to be taken up by chair but I’m not sure how safe that would be.  And there are lots of stalls on the way selling all sorts of stuff for tourists.Worth a visit but perhaps not everyone's cup of tea.

The steps are steep in places so take water if its warm.Once you get in the caves its essential to have a guide as the statues will mean nothing without the history of Shiva and his wife and other gods.It's amazing to think these were all carved and dug out of the caves by hand many many years previously.

You take a ferry from The Gate of India pier over to the island. You pay about $25 per person for the trip.The ride each way is an hour and costs 10 rupees per person each way. When you get to the island, don’t take the train. It doesn’t take you to the top of the hill as some websites suggest. You walk for about a mile and then pay to enter the park and then you pay 600 rupees per person to enter the UNESCO site. You walk up a long path with a number of stairs past vendors on either side of the walkway to get to the caves. It is covered, but be mindful of all the monkeys around.Some consider the 6th Century cave temple to be masterpieces of Indian sculpture. It was okay.The entire cave site can be seen in an hour.

You have to stand in a long and meandering queue (like the body of a serpent), before you are allowed to board the boat. You won't find the start of the line, believe me. The best thing would be to just go into the line from the middle. And try to take place at the front, or else you will have to wait an hour or two before boarding the boat. Once you do get in the boat , you have a nice and peaceful  and serene boat ride for an hour. You can watch seagulls flying pretty close to you or quietly floating on the water. After that, you come to your actual destination. However, the climb is sheer vertical. It is very cramped and the possibility of a fall (from the stairs) is very real. It is very exhaustive also. After reaching the top, you don’t feel it is worth it to  come all this way to see some broken sculptures made out of the mountains. Simply not worth it.",0.9618,5

Elephanta_Caves,Zippy,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,A few tips,"I read the review before going and would like to reinforce a few things. We went with a guide and I would recommend that. We went over on the boat which takes one hour fifteen. it’s very slow. if you have the funds, go on a speed boat! our guide queued for the tickets and helped us miss the queue a bit, saved us wandering about! We were on one of the first boats in the morning and you really don’t want to go in crowds or heat. When we got over there it was hot and muggy. We are both fit and walk a lot but it is a drag up to the site. It’s was only Feb and we had a good sweat on despite using the little train for the first part. Again our guide knew exactly where to stand to jump right on! The walk up is under a cover with market stalls either side. In March or after I imagine it would be boiling and crowded. It isn’t suitable if you struggle to walk as the path is also worn and slippy. Some crazy chaps will take you up and down on a sedan chair for about twenty quid! the little stalls are really good value compared to some places so bring a bag and get your nick nacks! the caves themselves are quite a site, big and open so don’t worry about claustrophobia. there is one main one and a couple others. We stayed about an hour as our guide told us all about it and we felt that was plenty.",0.4691,4

No bargaining fixed prices and help to guide new comers was available.But worrisome was the safety of tourists in the boats. I could see life jackets and a couple of inadequately sized and wrongly placed life boats were there. But no body is informed of any emergency procedures or any emergency phone numbers. The capacity of each boat was also not to be seen qnd no body was monitoring.The path from deboarding point upto cqves need mqssive cleaning and maintenance effort.

The transit takes approx 1hr, on departure and arrival you can get the best photos of the gateway and Taj hotel. There is a 'lazy train' which will transport you from the pier to the bottom of the hill for 10Rs (we did not take it). The assent up the hill is all under tarpulling and lined with souvenir stalls. You are required to pay a small tax on entry to the island of 10Rs each followed by 600Rs per adult for entry to the caves (40Rs for Indians). The main cave was amazing and we spent 90% of our time there, we were approached by a number of guides, we personally did not think one was needed. A great day out, we took approx 4.5hrs from departure to return. Watch out for scammers - we were approached at the port by a 'helpful gentleman' who informed us that because the cave did not have electricity that we should wait a few hours to go to the island and in the meantime give him $70 for a two hour tour of the city :-)",0.9393,5

You have a steep walk up to the caves entrance which may be an issue for some people although there are sedan chairs for those that can't manage the climb.

It was an extremely hot day, and a long walk to the village where one commenced the very long climb up steps to the Elephanta Caves, negotiating market stalls on either side (some with attractive goods, others with tat), which there was little time to stop and admire.  There was an alternative in the shape of a little tourist train, but I preferred the exercise, and felt smug to have arrived at the village before the train did!The island is a World Heritage Site, built on to hills, and consists of 7 caves, carved out of the rock, dating from the 3rd Century BC. The carvings are Brahmanical and mainly devoted to the worship of the Hindu god, Lord Shiva. The stonework in the smaller caves is sadly quite damaged, but is amazingly well-preserved in the huge main cave, portraying Shiva (the destroyer of evil) Parvati (his wife), Ganesha (their elephant-god son), and Vishnu (the preserver god) among others.

Disappointingly, the sculptures are quite badly damaged and the elephant statue (for which the caves were named) is not located here, it is at The Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum.Getting to the caves requires a 1 hour ferry ride to Elephanta Island, then a walk or toy train ride (the train was disgustingly filthy and bumpy) to the base of the ""hill"" containing the caves.  Our guide quite proudly told us to look at the beautiful mangroves beside the pier but you couldn't see them for the rubbish - so sad.There are quite a number of steps to climb to get to the caves and was a bit of a workout, but not so easy for older and frailer tourists.",-0.6054,1

The caves are still standing cause of Rock solid ancient architecture but the modern day pathetic maintenance will lead it to its ruins soon. There is 0 maintenance involved and the guards have turned into guides with little to no knowledge about the caves or that area. i wish they stopped the tourists from eating spitting and having a free run at a 2000 yr old historic site. caves are no doubt beautiful and have the architecture to give you goosebumps whilst thinking bout the amount of unprecedented hard work and perplexing technology our ancestors might have put in to build the caves. hope the local government will at-least electrify and maintain the site in near future to save it for coming generations .",-0.7625,1

It's a pleasant ride as seagulls follow you for the food.  We can take close-up pics and videos of them.  The ferry fellow charges extra Rs.20 for upper deck sitting.  From the arrival point at island there is a small train which take you to the near by starting point of the steps to the caves.  The train charge is Rs.10 for 2 way ride.  Or else you can walk for half a km.  From the stairs both sides shopping is a relief for the climbers but beware they charge exorbitant prices as they charge to the foreign tourists.  The caves entry fee is nominal for Indians.  We hired a guide for Rs.250 which I feel is reasonable and must to know the facts of the cave temple.  The main Temple cave complex is very important and rest of the other caves which are small can be skipped.  From out side the caves there a way to the uphill where you can see the Cannon.  We skipped it.  Near the alighting point of the train there are many snacks are available but be careful about the hygienic.  The returning ferry would wait till its get filled we have waited nearly half an hour for this. Overall for ferry it's 1 hour for 1 way.  1 to 2 hours for caves.  Waiting for ferry half an hour.

When we arrived we chose to walk all the way but there is a little train which takes you closer to the steps. The steps up to the caves are steep and lined with stalls selling souvenirs. We didn't feel hassled at all. To enter the island we had to pay 15 rupees each then to enter the caves we as foreigners had to pay 600 rupees each. The first cave was the most interesting & best preserved. There are lots of monkeys running around & can get very close to you. We saw a monkey snatch a ladies scarf.

Elephanta_Caves,Payal G,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Friends,Avoid on holidays,"Mismanaged is the first word that comes to mind followed closely by sad. Recent years have seen lot of administrative focus on maintaining and presenting our heritage. However, found this absolutely missing on revisiting Elephanta after more than a decade.First and the most important advice is to avoid going there on any public holidays. The steps leading to the caves have absolutely been covered up in tarpaulin sheets and shops line both the sides - resulting in a severely cramped space where people joustle for taking a step. It is creating a situation for a stampede. The lack of air is worse in the holiday crowd given Mumbai's muggy weather.There are 2 separate charges one for entering the island and the other for the caves - one wonders why they can't be collected at the same time instead of lining up twice. The toy train is a sham in such crowds. It is faster to walk up rather than pushing in the scramble to get on like on a fast local train.After all this trouble once one makes it to the main caves more disappointment awaits. For a UNESCO heritage site from which the Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation derives it's logo there is absolutely no information provided about the caves and the features one must look for. Probably for the benefit of the sham guides pestering people to take their services. The caves are poorly maintained with the overpowering stink of bat droppings. There is no lighting inside. Nor is any information on the sculptures available.With a return journey of atleast 3 hours on the ferry and another 2 on the island, one must keep atleast 5 hours in hand when planning a trip.      Contrary to many reviews there are lot of eateries around the steps with proper food and water available. The souvenirs are very pricey and cheaper in Mumbai.",-0.9395,1
Elephanta_Caves,hifunday,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Family,Easy day trip,Very convenient and inexpensive. And the sculptures are truly amazing. Boat ride to Elephanta Island from Gateway of India is comfortable. Takes around 40 minutes each way. Note that the small train between the jetty and the base of the steps to the caves is a bit of a scramble- particularly if it’s a holiday when you can expect greater crowds. My advice is just wait your turn and smile until you get to board it. Else if you are comfortable with walking - it’s not too long a distance. Remember though that once you get to the base of the caves there are still another 120 steps to go up the hill to reach the caves. And you need to plan for the journey back as well. At the base of the Island and on the steps to the caves there are lots of opportunities to shop and dine. Restrooms available only at the top and bottom of the 120 steps. Have fun!,0.9825,5

Elephanta_Caves,Deepak S,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Friends,A world heritage site to visit near Mumbai ,"An hour long ferry ride from the Gateway of India will take joy to this island that hosts the UNESCO world heritage site. Its 7 th century set of temple mainly of lord Shiva. The temple were carved out of the mountain and host some lovely sculpture work ; though a lot of these carvings have deteriorated over the centuries. The main carving of trimurty (three idols) of Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh is a well known Hinduism and cultural icon. After landing at the ferry site, a gentle climb with paved steps takes you up to the heritage shore. Totally 7 caves, our of which only 4 are accessible; others have become destabilised and are closed to visitors. Gives in idea about the well developed engineering skills of the time. The path leading up to the cave site is lined up with souvenir shops and food stalls, and is a bit narrow. Probably may benefit from some improvement like widening and landscaping and move the shops a bit away. Any one who is not used to lots of people around may feel a bit claustrophobic. But absolutely worth a visit.Another thing I noted : the ferry ride though very enjoyable could be more comfortable as it looked to be in need of maintenance. Broken seats, no safety drill or life jackets. It's almost 11 km long journey in the ocean and some attention to safety may help ; but this is something that is unfortunately typical of the subcontinent. But for foreigners, a unique experience and the site is a great opportunity to sample one of the oldest civilisation in the history of mankind. ",0.988,5
Elephanta_Caves,PRADIP DAS,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2019 • Family,Elephanta Caves ," Logo of MTDC (Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation) shows a 20 ft high monolith of the three-headed Trimurti Sadashiva representing the three aspects of Shiva: the right half-face signifying life and creativity; the left half-face, its obverse — the deity as a destructive force that can reduce the world to ashes; and the central face shows Shiva deep in meditation, as the protector of humanity. This awe-inspiring piece of carving, hewn out of rocks similar to Ellora in the same Maharastra  State, is the focal point of the Elephanta Caves, a small island about 10 km from Apollo Bunder, Mumbai. Both the Gateway of India and the Elephanta Caves are huge tourist attractions, and every year thousands of people from India and abroad visit the caves, whose carvings, dated mostly between the late 5th and late 8th centuries, narrate Hindu mythologies and depict various magnificent figures of Wedding of  Shiva with Parvati. Elephanta Caves can be reached by an hour-long enjoyable boat ride in the Arabian Sea from Gate-way-of-India. Originally known as Gharapuri, the island was renamed by Portuguese invaders after a giant stone sculpture of an Elephant, which was removed from the island and now stands outside the Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum.The Elephanta Caves in their entirety, and the forested areas around them, were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site  in 1987.

The information provided about the things to do/see/expect at the caves is not consistent and not enough. I would recommend buying an information book for Rs.150 or get a guide at the cave directly, which offer way less rate than if you book one at the bottom/ferry terminal. The ferry service itself sucks. It takes easily from 1 hr 15 mins to 1 hr 30 mins to get there. So expect to spend 4 to 5 hours if you are visiting only the caves 1 to 4, and more hours if you are planning to visit caves 6 and 7. The ferries are not maintained well, and different ferries may charge different rates depending on the deck you choose to be on.

Elephanta_Caves,Sweetbunnycute,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Friends,Worth paying a visit,"The caves are a beautiful art piece. Although it takes a little effort to go on an Elephanta caves tour one needs to spare one whole day bit according to me it is worth all the efforts. In order to visit the caves you need to go to the gateway of india, Mumbai. Buy a ferry ticket to Elephanta caves(available till 11 am only) and then the ferry takes about 50 minutes to take you to the island. There again you can either walk or take a short toy train ride till the caves. The same way one takes the route back to the gateway. The interesting thing is that one can collect souvenirs like fridge magnets or key chains or elephanta t-shirts from the market. Since there are steep steps hence i wouldn’t recommend aged people or people with problems in climbing stairs to visit here. The caves are no doubt huge and beautiful. They maie you wonder how they would have been carved. But some are damaged pieces so again you think of the story behind such destruction too. All in all it is a once in a lifetime experience where you go and explore the city for a whole day experience. Also recommended for one day picnic or a daytime tour.",-0.3716,2

Elephanta_Caves,Esbe2013,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Know before you go,"1. There are two rates for the ferries, there are two ticket prices, 150 & 205. The latter will get you into a slightly less crowded ferry ONLY on the way to the island. For the return journey, this will not happen. So think before you choose to pay more for one-way comfort.2. Getting ferries is easy. There's one leaving the Gateway every 10 minutes. 3. The ferries are properly operated, and you get to see much of the harbour. Plus snacks, soft drinks, and beverages, are sold on board the ferries. 4. There's a very mini mini-train (fairground variety), with return tickets priced at Rs.10 per person, which takes you about maybe 400 metres. It might be better to walk that distance rather than fight with holidaymakers for a seat on the train. It's a pleasant walk, too. 5. The stone steps that take you up to the top of the steep hill, need a degree of fitness. So be prepared. Those unable to tackle this can hire dandis, chairs supported by bamboo poles, carries by four men. These men, though they look old and fragile themselves, are possibly stronger and fitter than many gym rats. 6. The caves are worthwhile, and amply repay the climb. The site is well maintained. Security guards also keep monkeys away with slingshots. Besides, there are guides, and there are amazing views all around, too. 7. Temporary curio shops line the stairway up the hill, and there are restaurants interspersed, which seem clean and friendly. 8. There's a tourism department restaurant right at the top of the hill, next the caves' gate, which offers a good choice. 9. The return is easy, and in little more than half an hour you can be back at the jetty. There you take the launch that's ready to leave, and in an hour you're back at the Gateway.

Ferries run every 20 to 30 minutes. You can by the ticket for 205 rupees - both ways - at the entrance of Gateway of India. The deck is located immediately behind the monument - I found no indication of deck #4, as informed at the ticket counter where to take the boat. Once in the island you can take the minitrain or walk about 1 km to the first booth to collect local tax. After that there is an uphill walk among vendors until you reach the entrance and by your ticket - 600 rupees for foreigners. The largest and most important cave is #1. It has a small entrance but is almost 40 m deep with columns and wall carvings. Most of details have been eroded by time and looting but the remains are still impressive. The other caves are smaller and there was not much to see except for the space itself. There was no written historical information on display, so it is worth to read about it beforehand or bring some print information unless you want to pay someone who presents himself as a local guide. I spend two hours appreciating the caves and it was enough. Besides that, there was only an old cannon that did not interested me at all. This is not an activity that an handicapped person can do by him/herself - in addition to the minitrain, there are some people who can take you through the stairs by means of a पालकी - some kind of litter. Still, this primarily a walking tour. Last but not least, beware of the monkeys - one of them tried to steal my drink!

To spare my arthritic left knee, which seemed to be protesting the recent flights from the States, I hired a sedan chair, hoisted by four local men, to take me up the steep stone steps, which climbed past a gauntlet of souvenir vendors. I felt like a queen.	Dedicated to Shiva in his three roles – the Creator, the Preserver and the destroyer – the caves were so massive that they swallowed sound. Only by standing within ten feet of the guide for the site could we understand his explanations. As we discovered throughout the tour, local guides tend to be long on detail, explaining both the mythological significance of the carvings and the techniques used by the carvers. The first order of business had been chopping out and hauling away tons and tons of raw rock leaving rough pillars and niches for the artisans to go to work. Our guide explained that the teams of workmen probably possessed several levels of expertise, with the final, master carvers capable of extraordinary detail  We noticed that the breasts of Shiva’s consort and the other women depicted were invariably high and round and, in proportion to their slim waists, large.	On the launch back to Mumbai, several vendors accompanied us, hawking necklaces fashioned from carnelian, lapis, tiger’s eye and other semi-precious stones.

I feel it would be Rs. 170 per person.NB: If you have travelled by small boat to Elephanta cave jetty & if you wish to travel from Elephanta cave jetty by big boat with double deck system then show them your ticket of small boat, pay only extra Rs. 20 per ticket & you are allowed to board big boat.We made use of this system. It is a normal system for change from small boat to big boat while returning from Elephanta cave.NB: For to & fro journey, I will recommend readers to use big boat ferry with double deck system & sit on top deck to enjoy with Seagulls from very near.Even though boats do sell chips & wafers packet of Rs.10 for feeding to Seagulls, I will recommend the readers to buy groundnuts & similar such grain packets for Seagulls. Throw chips, wafer, groundnuts in air & Seagulls will catch it in their beak. You will be amazed to see their perfect catching ability. If it falls in water, they will pick it immediately. If you are holding it in your hand for Seagulls to come & eat then it is a lengthy process that requires a bit patience as Seagulls takes lot of time to come near you & eat it. 3)	Helpful Information From Elephanta Cave Jetty Onwards:a)	Elephanta Cave Jetty To Toy Train Start Station Ticket Shop:It is 50 meter walk. If you wish to travel by train for next 500 meter distance then buy train ticket & travel. Snacks, drinks stalls are there on the side of road.b)	Toy Train End Station Shop To Gram Panchayat Tax Ticket Counter:It is 50 meter walk.  Snacks, drinks stalls are there on both side of road.Pay the tax money & walk further.c)	Gram Panchayat Tax Ticket Counter To Steps Trek Route:It is 70 meter walk with shops as well restaurants on both side of road. d)	Steps Trek Route Start To Cave Entrance:There are palanquins at Rs. 2000 with return for those who can’t walk much.For next 300 meter, it is a walk thru steps with snacks stall, drinks stall, souvenir shops, restaurants on both side of road.e)	At Cave Entrance:At center is the main entrance gate to the cave.On your right, MTDC resort & road to two cannon view points.On your left is Santhosh restaurant & road to Elephanta Lake Garden.You have option to visit first Elephanta cave & then two cannon view points or first two cannon view points & then elephanta caves. Most tourists visit first cave & then cannon points.f)	At Elephanta Cave:i) Cave no. 1 to 5Enter the cave gate, buy the entrance ticket from the counter on your left & proceed to see cave no. 1 to 5. ii) Cave no. 1: This is the main cave having good carvings on wall. Visitors spend much time here seeing the carvings & taking plenty of photos. This cave is must place for visit.iii) Cave no. 2 to 5: These are only plain caves with no carvings on wall. From far away all these caves looks very good. When you go near there is nothing much apart from caves. The fifth cave will give you feeling of dissatisfaction. It is total 500 meter distance from 1st cave to 5th cave. There are plenty of sitting arrangement under the trees & shade for visitors to sit & relax plus the road layout gives a very good feel.iv) Cave no. 6 & 7I saw a map at the MTDC resort showing cave no. 6 & 7 behind cave no. 5.During your visit, please check on those caves thru security staff or cave staff there. If it is there then do visit it.v) Monkeys:There are plenty of monkeys. Don’t leave your small kids alone with any food or fruit in their hand otherwise monkeys will snatch it away.The best strategy is feed the monkeys with the food or fruit. I saw few families & kids feeding baby monkeys very happily with their hands. Baby monkeys were equally eating with graciousness. g)	Two Cannon View Points Trek:After completing visit to Elephanta caves, exit the entrance gate & turn left to proceed to the two cannon view points.1st cannon view point is at 500 meter up trek & 2nd cannon view point is at next 500 meter. The views from 2nd point & on the route to 2nd view point are amazing. The views from 1st cannon view point are blocked by the trees around. Still you can see the views thru the gap between the trees.You will see engineering marvel on how the cannons are fixed on the ground.There are couple of snacks drinks stalls on the cannon route.4)	Lunch Or Food:There are plenty of veg & non veg restaurant options for food after your Elephanta cave & cannon view point visit. Veg Non Veg thali & ala carte food system.All the restaurants are simple & looks very very decent.a)	 At Elephanta cave entrance, you have following two restaurant options: MTDC’s Chalukya Restaurant on left & Santhosh Restaurant on right.I have attached menu of MTDC restaurant.b)	 On route from Elephanta cave entrance till palanquin point or start of steps trek, you have following restaurant options:On your left: Rajmahal Restaurant, Elephanta’s Good Food, Elephanta’s Forest CanteenOn your right: Laxmi Restaurant, Maheshwari Restaurantc)	Immediately after palanquin point or start of steps trek till tax ticket counter:On your left: Elephanta Port Restaurant & BarOn your right: Elephanta Restaurant.

I especially appreciated the first and the second floors of the building where they have displayed a lot of  pictures , letters, coins and a depiction of various events. I though have a few issues with the place. (1) they sell books and I asked for a copy of a particular book in Hindi and the guy at the counter laughed and said “ we don’t keep Hindi versions”, that was a shame ! . (2) they don’t comply with accessibility guidelines and hence not easy for the old and handicapped. (3) there needs to be audio visual tools in the building for people who don’t come with a guide. Ideally you are left on your own to figure the place out. It’s a nice place with a lot of historical importance however like most historical places in India, with an exception of Rajasthan, this place too doesn’t know how to display the importance of a location and how to make it attractive for people who are visiting the place.

Global_Vipassana_Pagoda,Surabhi Deshpande,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020 • Friends,Worst experience ever - Surabhi Deshpande,"I had the most unpleasant experience at the Global Vipasaana Pagoda. Not only are the authorities ill-mannered, but also the staff is extremely rude. I was at the Pagoda on Saturday morning i.e. 15th February 2020 to meditate and before I realized I had to visit the Management ofrice to complain. Having entered the wrong gate and apologizing for doing so, not only was I questioned about my intention of doing so, but also I was asked numerous times as to why I was visiting the pagoda. After apologizing yet again and mentioning that the pagoda used to be open to the public a few years back and did not require a 10-day course in vipassana, a guide present there yelled at me asking me who gave you this information. Reiterating the same thing again, he yelled at me again saying that the pagoda has never been open to the public. So I merely questioned why he was being so rude and who was he to question me about anything at all. I was yelled at again, this time very loudly. So as a citizen would react, I headed to the management ofrice to complain and met with the Public Relations Officer - Mr. Shakti Kapoor. A very calm and cordial person to speak to, I vented out my issue. The worst part about my conversation with him was that instead of taking action against the rude staff, he began to explain he concept of 'Vipassana meditation'. Neither did he listen nor did he care. He instead declared that it was my fault and instead tried to shew me away by asking me to head to the lower level for meditation. I had absolutely no words for this sheer manipulation and hoax instituition and management. Being well educated and being in the profession of communication, the Officer lacked the ability to listen or take any action. To top it all, there was also a police officer present in the same room and chose to walk out while we watched me complain. I am surely never going back to this bogus place which they call 'sacred' when theu cant respect a human to behin with. I would just urge people to be careful about their encounter with people like these who know nothing but to manipulate and spoil your visit.",-0.9904,1

The trip from southern Mumbai there by train + autorickshaw + boat easily takes 3 hours (and this without any queueing - on our way back we saw the lines for the ferry had grown very long, it was a Sunday, maybe it's better mid-week), and the same back again. However, the trip by suburban train itself was an experience (you might want to get 1st class ticket, otherwise you'll get crushed or left out on the platform by the crowds, even on a Sunday). The building itself is new and looks impressive mainly for the size and from the distance. Inside the site it's a lot less impressive, we were done in less than half hour. The construction work is not finished and you cannot go inside the pagoda (you can peek through a dirty glass window, and it's just empty space, no decoration).

Essel_World,Roxanna M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2020,My wonderful experience as mentioned above.,"On January 14, 2020  my family and I visited the famed Essel World Bird Park in Mumbai, India.  I am from Canada and had been in India for about 2 months by then. The journey by rickshaw/ ferry/rickshaw to the park was a new experience for me and adventurous.  We arrived in  the afternoon and had a bit of a snack at the cafeteria, we started out on our tour of the park, following all the rules so that we do not harm our environment and for the safety of the birds and ourselves.  It was so clean and in fact there were some workers, scrubbing away in an empty pond which was impressive too, that great care and attention is paid to the minutest detail.Was wonderful to see all the variety of birds from all over the world and was fun trying to look for the hidden birds in the trees and bushes. The best experience of course was the feeding of the birds and for some reason they would land on top of our heads before flying down to the tray of seeds we were holding.   The smaller birds were in cages but large enough for them to still enjoy their freedom.   There were many unique birds and some were very colorful and we learnt a lot about the care and traits of the rare ones.We also enjoyed the parrot show in the small arena but afterwards was more fun watching the white cockatiels with their yellow plumes and how they could fan them open.At the end also got to browse through the information boards in the entrance way and all the while trying to identify the different chirping of the birds as they started settling down in their favourite places for the late evening/night to follow.All in all a very well maintained park with great loving attention to each species of which there were countless and caring staff on a rotation basis.Would recommend every resident and visitor of/to Mumbai to go there to have a wonderful fun time and admire the variety.I encourage all my friends in India and here in Canada as well to not miss the opportunity to visit this beautiful park where you can also gain so much knowledge.",0.9987,5

Also there are recharge stations located wherein the basic card can be recharged to any denomination.the silver ticket is advisable to be taken if someone is going to sit in most of the rides.If planning to sit in aqua dive..one is bound to get wet. carry extra clothing accordingly.,0.7841,5

They have arranged for buses from the car parking area to the main entrance (ticket booking area). These buses do a pickup from car parking to entrance and also a drop from entrance to car parking. Ticket counter was less crowded and we managed to get in quickly. The Essel world entrance and Water-Kingdom entrance is next to each other. Also is the Bird park which is inside Essel World. The place is clean with ample of shadow due to good amount of trees. Though summer season in month of April we did not feel the heat as much as it was outside. There are places where they have setup places for refilling water bottles. We saw two food courts which were pretty big. It was a good experience and until the day ended except the kids most of us were tired.May be next time we might try the bird park and/or Water Kingdom. ",0.9062,5

,,,,,"Recently i have visited Essel World with Friends. Even though the park is famous since the ages, being in Mumbai since last five years i haven't visited it before. I still remember TV add ""Essel world me rahunga me, Ghar nahi jaunga me :P :P"". You can reach EsselWorld easily from Borivali railway station. From borivali railway station you can take shared auto to Gorai creek which will cost you around 20 per seat. Then from Gorai creek you have to take ferry services to cross the creek. It will cost you around 50rs for return ride. Ferry will drop you at the gate of Water kingdom.Now Come on to the attraction, if you enjoy adventurous rides then ""Thunder"", ""Top Spin"" and especially the ""Enterprise"" rides are there for you. The whole will rotate once you out from enterprise. Certainly not the ride after food. Even Thunder will also make you scared. It will hold you upside down for certain amount time. Certainly not a ride for light heated person.Shoot-N-Drop, Hoola - Loop and Zyclone are also good. Recently they have added Ride with VR named ""Tunnel Twister"". The ride will take you in the world of Virtual Reality.There are certain paid activities which you can enjoy also like Ice Skating, Laser tag, 7D shows and many more. Food outlets are fantastic.  Even with lots of amount ride EsselWorld lack in terms of shows which you can find in Imagica. So overall of you enjoy adventures rides then visit EsselWorld and if you enjoy shows more then visit Imagica.",0.9907,5

Kanheri_Caves,Juliette Z,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2023 • Couples,"Beautiful, inspiring, ancient Buddhist caves (find Pawan for tour)","We had the most AMAZING morning at Kanheri Caves. We took Uber both ways from Mumbai (worked really well) & rented bikes for the road up to the base of the caves. Just after the entrance to the caves we met a security guard named Pawan. He has worked at Kanheri for 20 years and is super knowledgeable about the caves’ history, explaining how the caves were used, pointing out Pali script & explaining different buddhas & carved figures. He really was fantastic and we highly recommend him. Again, he is not a guide, but a security guard who has made it his personal mission to learn and teach about these extraordinary caves.As there is no tree cover around the mountain caves, it’s best to visit in the AM. We arrived at park ~8:15 & got to the cave trail base as it opened at 9am (closed on Mondays).",0.9477,5

Kanheri_Caves,NZBLR,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,Average Place,"Good place, its inside Sanjay Gandhi National Park, once you purchase a ticket for the national park & go inside you have an option to board a bus or travel in an OMNI car, (private cars are not allowed beyond ticket counter), the bus fare is Rs 20 per head, the omni fare depends on the clothes you are wearing ;-) might range from Rs 100 per person to Rs 500 depending on how rich or poor you are looking, the distance is covered in 20 mins, don't attempt to walk unless you are super fit. The caves have a separate ticket counter & that closes by 5 PM, ensure that you reach before that & the last return bus is at 6:15 PM, if you miss that then you are again at the mercy of the OMNI cab drivers who can demand any amount they wish, from the bus to the caves there are 120 odd steps to climb, the entire place needs at least 3 hours to cover, its not too good or bad, can be visited if you have day at leisure.",0.8553,5

It took a few European friends of mine who were on their very first visit to India who got a strong recommendation for Kanheri Caves from a German tourist to have me explore the idea.  Nestled in Borivali East is a world that seems unexplored, untouched. Blanketed in green, enveloped on all sides by Mother Nature, these caves are perhaps the most untouched part of this crazy chaotic city of Mumbai. You'll find it difficult to believe that we five were the ONLY tourists in this entire Kanheri zone. These Buddhist caves are archaeological heritage monuments dating back to the period between 1st&10th century AD. A total of 110 caves including some that are inaccessible have the most aweinspiring carvings, frescoes & ancient paintings & engravings that one can ever imagine. The access to these caves is from brilliantly maintained stairways that are as ancient as the caves themselves. The acoustics of some of the caves are phenomenal with perfect echoing that lends a mystic aura to the site. One of the security guards offered to share his knowledge about the caves, precious information on their history, especially the different mudras of the Buddhist statues & the various components of the sculptures.Make it a point to visit the topmost point which is a table-top part of the hillock.Impossible to believe that such a serene verdant slice of land is a part of the cacophonic city of Mumbai.",0.9513,5

Some of the caves are much and much alike but there's some stunning caves as you walk round. These have amazing images of buddah carved into  the stone and large Pillars. It's set on a hillside and will involve lots of steps. Make sure you wear comfortable shoes. Suggest having plenty of water with you.

There are several caves and you have to climb steps to reach all the caves. Some of the caves have statues and there is one cave which contains two large statues of Budha. If you like historical sites then you will enjoy the visit. I use a walking stick and I held the rails to climb the steps. There is a small cafe which sells sodas and some snacks.

Kanheri_Caves,Sourabh D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2020,Can't miss it for anything,"Kanheri caves in Sanjay Gandhi National park is a hidden gem; within the city limits of Mumbai. Extraordinary vegetation and clean environment. There are many activities (Lion/Tiger Safaris, Forest trails, Toy train etc etc.) that one could do here. However a day may not be enough if you want to do all. So prioritize.One could take a car or rent a bike inside the entrance gate. There have been some recent rate hikes, but they all seem reasonable, looking at the improved upkeep and cleanliness of the place and also a lot of new infrastructure being put in.1.	Kanheri caves reside in midst of this vast forest. You need a separate ticket for this at nominal cost. The caves are much more cleaner now and securely locked up during off hours. There are new railings put in and a new complex coming up with public utilities and cafeteria etc.2.	It is wise to be there early to beat the sun and heat. Carry water a snacks along. Wear comfortable sports shoes and clothes.3.	It would be always a good idea to read up a bit about the caves and make a few notes before; like we did. This will make things easier to spot and one would not roam about aimlessly. Afterall there are 109 caves scattered over a wide area. The caves otherwise look the same, so its best to know the background and nuances a bit.4.	The caves are largely ‘Viharas” (Buddhist Monastery) and are stone cut, more than 2200 years old. The rocks are black basaltic.5.	Caves 1, 2, 3 (Chaitya hall with a large stupa, similar to Karla caves but smaller), 4 are notably the most talked about and interesting. So are 5 and 6 (Water cistern),  11 (Darbar hall),  34 (has an unfinished paining of Buddha on the ceiling), 41, 67, 81, 90. Cave 41 has a unique sculpture of Buddha with several small heads over the main head.6.	You will find inscriptions at various places in 3 different ancient scripts: Brahmi, Devanagari and Pahlavi.7.	Once you are done with the caves, don’t forget to climb on the topmost part of the caves to take a panoramic view of the forest and farther into the city, almost upto Powai. Beautiful sight.8.	On the way back, there is a small canteen for cold drinks and snacks. Further down you have fruit shops too. Beware of the monkeys who are all to eager to partake your food.Highly recommended trek anytime of the year but mostly winter months or early morning in summers. Monsoons are also great if you are careful and avoid slippery tracks.",0.9941,5

If you don't have a personal car, you can also take an Ola or Uber inside the forest to the caves. The local cars operating at the gate are not recommended and are expensive.",0.9083,5

Kanheri_Caves,Sandy J,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020,Worth the trip,"If you aren't seeing any other Buddhist caves while in India, it is worth a trip to visit these.

Kanheri_Caves,Maresa G,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2020 • Couples,The Green Lung of Mumbai,"This was a well-worth it 5 hour trip away from the hustle and bustle of polluted, noisy Mumbai central, when we had some time to spare while waiting for a late night flight out to Hyderabad.I was determined to use the local metro and train services since experiencing the daily gridlocked traffic while being in Mumbai for the past few days.And we proved how cheaply one can actually travel here with the very reliable and efficient local transport services provided.  Our hotel was fortunately situated close to the Airport Station metro, and for INR40 we went to the Andheri Station.  From there we caught the local train for INR20 to Boliwari station.From there we took a tuk tuk for INR60 to the entrance of the Sanjay Gandhi National Park.Entrance fees at the gate is INR 64 each.We opted to walk the 7km to the entrance to the caves, a long languid stroll in the heat, which took us about 1.5 hrs.  It is a welcome relief to be away from the city traffic noise, and to just hear the occasional bird or the rustle of a deer or a few monkeys.The city is still pretty close by, as one can still see buildings to the right of your pathway much of the walk towards the caves, and the air still hangs heavily with city pollution, but it is a mild breath of fresh(er) air here in the ""lung of Mumbai"".The walk becomes slightly more uphill closer to the entrance to the caves, but not exceptionally steep.The entrance fee to the caves is INR300 for foreigners.These 3rd century Buddhist caves are quite a marvel as the over 100 caves are carved out of a single rock. There is also evidence of the earliest rain-water harvesting system they had going in that era.There is a fair bit of climbing up and down stairs for a few hours, and one has a panaromic view of Mumbai's smoggy skyline once at the top.We took the bus back down to the entrance (for INR20) which was fortunately full when we got to it, so we could leave fairly immediately.We went back via local transport the same way we came.A most pleasant day trip to ""clear"" the mind from daily Mumbai madness!!

Kanheri_Caves,Jeff,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019 • Family,Visit to the famous Kanheri caves,"Most of you would agree with me when I say  that Mumbai has the ingredients for a hill station as well as a tourist place. It has greenery, sea shores and urban jungle. But other than a commercial center, Mumbai is never considered as a hill station. But if you want to feel like you are in a hill station, then you must visit Kanheri Caves. I know it has been around Mumbai for a really long time, but we never bother to visit it and some of us would not have even heard of it. So if you do hear about it, then plan to visit it and make it happen. I don't have the exact knowledge of how the caves were built and when it happened, but you can get all that information from the local guides over there. The entry to the caves is ₹25 (for Indian Citizens) and ₹300(for foreign nationals). The journey from the bottom to top is a good 1 hour trek, although there are steps to make life easier. For those who are not prepared to hike or those who are lazy, the walk to the top may be a bit tiring. But once you get to the top, the view is amazing. You get a nice panoramic view of the greenery of the Sanjay Gandhi National Park which spans over a wide expanse. If it is isn't quite sunny then it is quite pleasant at the top. Weekends may be a bit crowded, but the crowd is generally concentrated at the lower levels, after that it gets filtered. Its a good half a day outing for a family and a must visit if you are a localite, because we often ignore the things that are most closer and obvious to us. ",0.9816,5

Kanheri_Caves,macedonboy,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Buddhist cave temples,"The Kanheri Caves are Buddhist cave temples and fine examples of the rock-cut architecture of India. Most of the caves are relatively simple and largely undecorated. The main exceptions are caves 1 to 4, which are all near the entrance. Cave 3 is the Chaitya and probably the most impressive of all the cave temples as it has a pillared hall with a stupa at the end of the hall. All the pillars have richly decorated capitals depicting scenes featuring elephants.Cave no. 11 is also worth visiting and spending some time as it’s the Darbar Hall. Although the hall is simple, it is one of the few examples of ancient Buddhist Darbar halls and shows how the congregation would’ve assembled.Most of the remainder of the temples are very simple one room caves with no decorations.Overall, the temples are simple compared to the Elephanta Caves. It’s worth visiting for see earlier examples of Buddhist rock-cut temples and trace the evolution of the architecture prior to Elephanta. The views from high up on the hills of the surrounding area are fantastic and you can also just about see metropolitan MumbaiFor the more adventurous, you can visit the temples using local transport by getting a train to Borivali Railway Station, walk 15 minutes to the entrance of Sanjay Gandhi National Park, then the 188 bus from inside the park for the 15 minute bus ride to the foothills of the caves.",0.9183,5

(INR 50 something only) # At the park entrance you need to pay for the park but this is not for caves. * Do not declare your cameras or pay for Camera there unless you are planning to do activities in the national park. * This is a rip off! # Once entered, proceed & ask for Kanheri caves Bus. (mostly red colour old bus parked close to the entrance of the park) Ride is INR 10 & 5km to go. # You will pay again at caves entrance for entry ticket (Foreign - INR 300) & there you can get a pass for camera costing INR 25.",0.5696,5

I wasn’t as impressed with the 12x entry cost vs locals (RP300 for foreigners), and much more should be done within the National Park to clear up the litter.Getting there and back could be a challenge: I travelled there by Taxi for RP400 and back to Andheri railway station by train for RP10.

I can never get enough of that ancient ambience in the midst of the forest,  and there is no such thing as a visit too many.  My most recent visit was last Saturday at 0900 sharp when the caves ticket counter opened.  The undergrowth was pretty and green but the rocks and pathways were now dry and unslippery so I decided to cross to the grassy plateau above the ruined caves  on the other side of the little bridge.  I found the easiest way up and there I was all alone except for a troop of shy golden langurs minding their own business.  I walked a bit along the rocky plateau enjoying the vistas of the vast forest and the city towers in the background on one side and the main group of caves on the other.  The langurs let me come fairly near, though not quite close enough for a Selfie :-)))  They were very very cute.  There are remnants of ruined stupas on this plateau as well but it was rather warm in the open and I did not venture too far beyond.   If only the ASI would allow visitors from sunrise, it would be so much more pleasant.   I crossed back by a rough hewn stone staircase to  the main caves on the other side.I have explored the caves many times so on this visit, I was more just ambling along taking in the atmosphere of this ancient site (2000+ years old).   A rather grumpy looking big brown monkey suddenly jumped off the rock face and bounded near, it wasn't me he was looking for .. a man in front of me had just  given a biscuit to his little girl whom the mother was holding on her shoulder.  In the blink of an eyelid, the monkey jumped up behind the woman and snatched the biscuit from the baby's hand.  The child started howling but fortunately had not been scratched and a few moments and some pacifying later, the little girl said ""Bye Monkey"" ... it was both terrifying and sweet.  I decided not to eat my  Vada Pao from my backpack, in any case I was sweating profusely with the heightened humidity by then and was not hungry at all.  I had a sip of water, later my water bottle was missing from the pouch on the side of my bag, maybe Bad Monkey stole it???      Definitely not a good idea to display food in front of the monkeys.  They will see it, no matter where they are and they will come to demand their fair share.  I experienced this in Shimla and in Badami where the monkeys were even more bold than their cousins here.Making my way uphill, I chose to wander past the lesser seen caves which dont have any impressive carvings.   I found some crumbling carvings in a pitch black cave interior which I doubt I had ever seen before and I thought I had seen the caves comprehensively including the rarely visited necropolis.  Forgot unfortunately to note the cave numbers.  The path here was narrow and seemed damaged, perhaps by the unprecedented heavy monsoons this year.  It led nowhere or rather to the forest edge, an adventurous person may have been able to skirt the rock edge and clamber up to the next level but not me, the last I needed was to fall and that too with no one around.  I found my way up an uneven staircase to another level near the carved Caves 89 & 90 and then to the rock hewn steps going steeply all the way down to the main cluster of Caves 4 to 1.  By this time it was very warm, I was perspiring even more, grateful for my hat but discovered that my water bottle was lost.  It was barely 11am and so warm!  October is ofcourse the second summer in Mumbai, this year we had extended rains so got used to the pleasant monsoon weather and the rather hot day was a  bit of a shock.Cave 4 is small with a  stupa and carvings all around the wall, always worth a look see.  Cave 3 is the main Chaitya hall with the two massive Buddha statues just outside.  They are suitably impressive, every time!  Eventually I made my way back to the car park and pushed off home.  Fortunately being after 12noon the highway traffic was moving and not the nightmare it would have been an hour earlier.Kanheri Caves are within the SGNP.  BEST buses ply at certain intervals from Borivili East station all the way to the caves which is a convenient way to come and of course coming by train to Borivili East is the quickest and cheapest ... provided you can handle Mumbai's local train travel.  Early in the morning is not a problem.  Avoid peak hours which tend to extend till around 11.30.Cave entry is INR25 per head for Indians and an exorbitant INR300 p/h for foreigners.  You also need to buy an entry ticket to the National Park.  Kanheri Caves managed by the ASI are closed Mondays.  The Adivasis set up food stalls at the base at the car parking area and there is also a small restaurant as well as toilets.Comfortable walking footwear is a must and a hat will give you respite from the unmerciful sun.  The caves are not really suitable for the disabled, for small children or for anyone who is inclined to fall.  Be very careful of monkeys if you have food with you, make sure it is well hidden in your bag and take it out only if the coast is clear ... or suffer the monkey consequences!An entire day can be spent at the Kanheri Caves if you can handle the weather.  The ASI security guards are all over the place so it is quite safe unlike in the past.  The guards also double up as guides for a negotiable fee and are happy to show visitors the significant caves, some of which are locked to prevent vandalism and to deter lovers from making  it their nest.  The guards have the keys so it makes eminent sense to engage them as guides should you need a guide.Read up about the caves a little bit before you go, it will make your trip that much more rewarding.As I said earlier, the Kanheri Caves are my favourite place for an outing in Mumbai.

Kanheri_Caves,Pumiann,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019,I loved the caves and the park is truly awesome,"For me I was lucky, I met somebody that took me around the caves as a friend. I have no idea what the guide situation might be here. I suspect non-existent. I was quoted US$120 by a company wanting to show me round this place before I went when I was enquiring from TripAdvisor. You can certainly visit the caves themselves by yourself, although there isn’t any specific information at each cave which I felt was lacking, but it might actually not be known. And I suspect any ‘professional‘ company advertising such a tour probably wouldn’t know either. Who knows how these people lived way back in the first century and what the purpose was of all these dwellings.Really great fun to wander around and see each cave and Wonder a bit further up to the top and over the other side a little bit. Kind of off the beaten track. Great fun getting lost.The park itself is really lovely, beautiful in a busy area of Mumbai.  Stunning views over Mumbai the higher up you get.A complete nightmare trying to get from the park gates to the caves which is 7 km. Okay if you want to walk then fine, it’s on made Road Way. Or there was a guy trying to rent out to very very old what he described as ‘bicycles‘ at the gate I didn’t enquire as to the cost. The vehicles that will take you from the park gates to the caves, I’m quite happy to rip you off as much as they can, particularly if you are a foreigner so beware. Coming back as well same problem. You can wait for the bus of course, but I suspect (I didn’t do this) could you could be waiting a couple of hours for the bus to fill up before it would go off, and on a quiet day, which it was when I went there you could be sitting for hours.  That’s where the management of this park is really seriously lacking. How much does it cost to vehicle, a small vehicle that would hold six people to travel 6 km??? And the time of the driver, well if he’s not doing anything else???You have to pay to get into the park, which was quite minimal, but when you get to the caves, the entrance fee is Rs.25 Indians… Rs.300 foreigners. Where did they get this figure from I wonder???  Okay maybe we don’t mind paying a little bit more, but that sort of percentage ‘tourist Tax’ is a joke. I would’ve given the caves themselves a five star rating has someone interested in nature, Buddhism and a little bit of tracking. And the park itself will also five stars for being where it is I’m doing what it does.But you can read above the reason why it only has three stars.",0.9946,5

The plan was to visit Kanheri Caves and then if time permits, visit the zoo at SGNP. The Kanheri caves are located deep inside the Sanjay Gandhi National Park - around 7 kms from the SGNP entrance area. A fee is collected as entrance to the SGNP - Rs.58 per adult, Rs.31 per child and Rs.195 for a car. We had pay for the driver as well. Quite high for an entry to an area and again, we need to buy ASI site entry fee (Rs.25 per adult) to enter Kanheri caves. The Kanheri caves are dated back to 1 BC and are believed to be one of the oldest cave formations of India. There are 109 caves in the location. The road to Kanheri caves is well laid and the whole place is a forest.The caves are Buddhist shrines and an important place of prominence during the Buddhist settlement. Out of the 109, hardly 5 caves have the sculptures. Rest of the caves have a plinth like structure where people can sit and meditate or take rest. The caves with sculptures are Cave 3, 11, 34, 41, 67 and 87. The cave with sculptures are not so ornamental, however couple of them have big Buddhist sculptures and stupa. Cave 3 has a large Avalokiteshvara sculpture. One of the caves has a magnificent meditation centre - very good acoustics. The sun was quite harsh on the day and we made a quick walk around the caves. Rest of the caves are all very near to each other and almost all have a plinth like structure and nothing more. The pathway is maintained really well and at places quite steep for elders. One can cover all caves in 90 minutes, however, apart from the mentioned numbers nothing really holds any sculptures.We spent around 45 minutes and turned back after seeing most of the sculpted caves.

There are a total of 109 caves. Each cave has a stone plinth that functioned as a bed. There is a congregation hall with huge stone pillars containing a Stupa. There are rock-cut channels above the caves which fed rainwater into cisterns, to provide the complex with water. The walls of the caves are carved with intricate reliefs of Buddha and the Bodhisattvas. Most of the caves were Viharas, meant to be used for living, studying, and meditating. The larger caves, functioned as Chaityas, or halls for worship. These are lined with intricately carved Buddhist sculptures, reliefs, pillars and rock-cut stupas.

Kanheri_Caves,Dave,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2019 • Solo,Kanheri Caves,"This morning I took an Uber from Goregaon East to the entrance gates to the Sanjay Gandhi National Park. Taxis, Ubers and the like are not allowed into the park. So, after paying an entrance fee of 58 rupees to enter the park, I had to negotiate for a driver to take me up to the entrance to the Kanheri Caves. We settled on a fee of 1 000 rupees for the round trip of 14km.The driver proved to be very knowledgable. He was born in the reserve and lives in one of its villages. He waited for me for while I spent an hour walking around the caves.Before proceeding, I had to pay the foreigner's entry fee, which has increased to 300 rupees - more than ten times what Indian citizens pay. I do think the authorities should consider a reduced fee for citizens of BRICS countries. Our currencies are not strong and visas for us to enter India are free.Anyway, my visit to the caves was most interesting. If you read up beforehand, there's no reason for a guide. The driver suggested that I restrict myself to 5 of the 109 caves: Numbers 2,3,11, 34 and 67. A very helpful security guard, who gave me an extensive free tour of Cave 3, suggested that I add Number 41 to the list and this proved to be good advice.There is quite a lot of clambering up steps hewn into the basalt rock so stout, closed walking shoes are recommended in addition to a bottle of drinking water.It is mind-boggling to think that Buddhist monks carved these caves and the magnificent sculptures in them by hand.An hour was just sufficient to see the six caves. After that, I met the driver who drove me back to the park gates.

Kanheri_Caves,Ekta N,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Friends,Treasure in amidst a City like Mumbai,"This one is located inside Sanjay Gandhi National Park. It’s a 7 kms walk from the Park entry. There are cars available to transport you from the gate where they charge per person. One can hire a cycle too at Rs.80 per hour or per two hours depending on whether you take it from a private vendor or the park authorities. A cycle/ two wheeler/car can go upto the area from where the steps to the caves start. Walking the 7 kms stretch does get little boring by the end and might be tiring for those who do not walk or run regularly, specially the long ramp that leads to the steps. It’s a nice road surrounded by trees and few reindeers on the way and a lot of monkeys..The caves are maintained very well and kept very clean. There is one restaurant at the foot of the caves which serves basic dishes but beware of monkeys. There are about 109 caves altogether. Above the caves is a spot which is the highest point there and the view of the forest all around is worth the climbing up.Please note that the park opens to public at 7.30 am. Before that only those with a pass are allowed to go. It’s best to spend time there before the sun heat rises. A DSLR camera or lens with a zoom of more than 35 x is chargeable to take inside. The charges are around 3000 Rs. which is pretty ridiculous for non professional photographers. Wear comfortable shoes and carry water.",0.9441,5

Do any eating within the designated cafe area...and then proceed. Or, grab a bite just before you exit. The scale of the beautiful carvings, and the living spaces carved out of sheer rock by monks of yore, are a genuine awe-inspiring wonder.

Hi Govind P

Thanks for your concern and observations.
We believe that spirituality is a deeper science. 
Our rituals and worship help us to realize something higher and connect to the divine spiritual.
Temple is a place of God where everyone is allowed to come 'closer' to him.

Worshiping the Supreme God is like watering the root of the tree.When a tree is watered at the root, the water reaches to all branches, leaves, fruits and flowers.
Similarly, all living entities, the environment is part of the Supreme Lord.

When Supreme God is worshiped in proper consciousness, that service attitude extends toward His creation.We also have many social causes associated with our temple.

One of that is Mid-Day Meals program where almost 1.2 million underprivileged children are given one meal at their school everyday, in India.
Everyone is welcome to become part of our projects.

I hope this is all right with you.",0.9908,5

Colaba_Causeway,Malini N,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Family,The flavour of old Mumbai,"Colaba Causeway is a lovely street to laze around, shop for little gifts, clothing and jewellery from the road side, as well as hop into old eateries and cafes to taste a variety of tantalizing food! You also get to pick some really good restaurants to suit various budgets in and around this place. It is also a stone's throw away from the iconic Taj Mahal Palace & Towers and the sea is right round the corner along with the Gateway of India. Depending on the time of the day you can also catch a boat ride from the ferry wharfs. You can pick up modest Kurtas, comfortable pants, tee shirts, traditional imitation jewellery, lovely little craft and gift items etc. The vendors who have been around for ages, are open to bargaining and you can manage a good deal. I have found most of the stuff from here to be of good quality. You will generally find the shop-keepers friendly and helpful. The quaint ambience of old Mumbai is really a wonderful experience.

I bought a nice marble elephant there for a good price.This is well worth visiting. Note that the market does not really start until around 12 noon and goes late into the night.

Colaba_Causeway,elvin2018,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2018 • Family,A SLICE OF MUMBAI,"Colaba Causeway is one among the iconic spots that define the character and vibrancy of Mumbai (Bombay). It is always teeming with tourists and local shoppers which makes it crowded with very little personal space which too is a trait of Mumbai. In days of yore it was a prestigious place to live, being very very close to Bombay University the High Court, the Cathedral colleges, library and art galleries Today it is fully commercial, with one side covered with  street stalls selling artificial jewellery, handicrafts, old coins, curios, antiques,  artefacts, casual wear,  souvenirs,etc. This is the crowded part.. One needs to heavily bargain here and it is quite possible to walk away paying even half or a third of the quoted price.(Foreign tourists please note this) . One cannot be sure about the genuineness of any branded stuff or antique sold on these footpaths.However, apart from the footpath, are regular shops on either side selling genuine branded clothes, footwear, accessories, fabrics as also many eateries to suit all budgets and tastes.( Leopolds, Churchill, Delhi Durbar, Food Inn, Cafe Mondegar, Kamat's...to name a few) There are economically priced hotels on the side roads as also the iconic Taj  Mahal Hotel and the Gateway of India closeby.In fact this area is at one end of the 'heritage precinct' that stretches from here right up to Crawford Market, via Flora Fountain and Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus, with beautiful  and historic buildings with Gothic and Indo-Sarcenic  architecture.

Sanjay_Gandhi_National_Park,Venky63,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2023,Sanjay Gandhi National Park-not easy to get into,"Today was my first visit to the Park, even though I have lived in Mumbai for many years. I planned to get Kanheri caves but overall it was a disappointing experience. a)It is easy to get to the Park itself on the WE Highway. b)But getting into the Park is another story! You have to park your car and either walk many kms inside or you have to take a BEST bus. Or you have to cycle your way. I couldn't do both with an injured foot.c)There not enough buses as the queue is a long one at all times. d)There is an alternative I found out later of taking some van taxis. Its not fair to allow them when passengers can't take their cars. e)The entry fee of 85/- and parking charges of 242/- are not reasonable.The park authorities must find another alternative of having multiple parking spaces at various points in the park. That way one can get to a point and then choose to walk around.Overall, unless you want to walk 6+ kms or cycle on a hot day(which it will be on most days in Mumbai) there are no easy options.",0.153,4
Sanjay_Gandhi_National_Park,Kirsty N,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2022,Private one day tour of the park,"So.... as a foreign visitor, there seem to be two ways to visit the park, and they are completely different experiences and require different levels of organisation. You can just turn up, in which case you can enjoy the large recreational area near the Borivali Gate, which has a pretty lake with boating, gardens, a Cat Orientation centre, an introductory Interpretation Centre, etc (quite good, especially for children). You can then get the local bus further into the park, for the 7km trip up to Kanheri caves, a complex of about 100 Buddhist caves in the hills. You don't need a private car to do this! At weekends however the bus queues are long, so go during the week. Or, you can hire a guide for a half day or day, in which case you can actually walk one of the several trails through the park. We would highly recommend this. You shouldn't do this without a guide. The crucial thing to understand is that the great majority of the park is truly a reserve, and it's large: about 100 sq km. There are about 50 adult leopards in residence, plus all the other usual residents, snaky and otherwise. They need peace, and the public needs to be kept safe.Hiring the guide was the real challenge, as the park's website was down, but we cracked it. You need to book through the NIC (Nature Information Centre): again the website didn't work (they make you work for this!) so we tracked them down on Facebook. We communicated with a gentleman called Samarth. who arranged our guide. For a full day, this cost 2,500 rupees per person, paid in cash on the day.We would highly recommend the full day. We met our guide Naman at 8am and spent the morning walking the Kanheri Trail: 8am is a little late for birds though we did see some, but Naman's knowledge of trees, plants, forest ecology, geology, animal scat (poo to you and me) and calls, was excellent. We found ourselves following a line of leopard scrapes up through the woods, and finally came out across from the caves. Just below the caves are pretty gardens and a ""canteen"" where we ate early lunch. Basic Indian snack/breakfast food, but delicious.In the afternoon, Naman turned from a nature guide to a cultural one, and did a fine job of guiding us around the cave complex. Well worth seeing, and go right to the top above the caves too, to get a view of the whole park. You will find yourself on the top of a huge lava dome, in the middle of the remains of a massive and ancient crater (approx 65 million years). Mumbai is on the edge of the Deccan Traps (look it up... remarkable)After the caves, we visited the recreational area, and then our day was done, by about 4.30. It's a long day and you need a certain amount of energy, but we're in our 60's/70's and did fine. Naman was the perfect guide, adapting to our pace, checking that we were ok, and entertaining us with stories: lovely company.SGNP is a remarkable phenomenon: a functioning very large  wildlife reserve in the middle of a megacity: it's beautiful and needs funding, so go!",0.9973,5

Most of the activities are available only on weekends so do check out before you go there. The park opens for normal public only at 8am, so don’t go in too early. The weekly off is on Monday for SGNPPlan: Included a butterfly trail and Tiger & Lion Safari (added bonus was the boating activity)Butterfly Park: We started from our homes at 7-7.15am as the butterfly trail starts after 8am. The butterflies need sunlight to flutter and fly about. So, we reached SGNP to meet our intern who took us into the auditorium for a 30min info session on butterflies. Given, it was a winter morning – the sun still wasn’t bright and out, so we had our breakfast boxes first and then headed for our simple / short 1 hour trail across the park. We saw lots of butterflies on our trail, and they were so attracted to the rattlepod plants. We saw the common crow, common tiger, striped tiger, blue tiger, great orange tip, common emigrant, zebra blue, lots of moth caterpillars, ladybugs, Jerdon’s baza, etc. The children enjoyed walking in the small pathways and seeing so many butterflies. An easy route around the park that can be enjoyed by adults and kids. After finishing the trail at 10am, we cut the birthday cake and headed to the Lion and Tiger SafariLion and Tiger Safari – a  short bus ride to see caged Lions and tigers. While the lions were sleeping under the sun, the tiger came and gave us a majestic ramp walk before it went inside. Good for children to see animals 1st hand, but more a 1-time visitBoating – they have 2 seater and 4-seater boats that you can take out in the Dahisar River for a 15-20 minute ride. Its fun for the children to enjoy the boating activityOverall, we had a lot of fun and the children didn’t want to return home even at 12pmI would also recommend exploring the Shilonda Trail with children. It’s a trail for 1.5 hours with a break near a lovely stream.

The entry fee for a solo person without a vehicle is about 50 rupees if I remember correctly. They have a map of the park inside. I walked towards the Kanheri/ Buddhist caves although returned by bus which takes 10 rupees till end. The walk is about 8km alongside a tarred road. On the way I witnessed deers going about their day, a snake and birds which could be easily heard but not seen. There's a river flowing on the way. Stray dogs can be a nuisance and could attack but locals help out. People sell lime juice on the way. At the end of the road near the caves there are stalls selling food, refreshments however monkeys are a nuisance here and can snatch away the food.There is a main shallow cave which is majestic with carvings related to Buddha and stages of enlightenment with the mudras, etc from what I could figure out. Beyond this there are many other caves ahead and above where a settlement seems to have existed. Very very interesting. One can climb the rock that hosts all the caves without much difficulty. From the top of the rock buildings of Mumbai could be seen. I only realised I'm still in Mumbai after the climb to the top. Till then one is well hidden from the city. One can easily spend half a day in all this. There is occasional annoyance from 'untamed teenagers', other than that families, groups, solos and couples seem to visit here.

Below are some of the highlights which will help you to plan your trip1. Lion/Tiger Safari - You have to take a bus ride for the Safari. Sit on the left side. They had a lion, lioness, tiger, tigress in individual cages. Go early morning and you will see them. You might also spot a few deers. You are not allowed to get off the bus. It is a 15-20 ride once the bus starts. You might have to wait for the bus to get a little full before they start. 2. Boating - They have 4 & 2 seater paddle boats. Again do this early in the morning. It is a small pond with very minimal shade. Kids loved it. They have life jackets for all to wear.3. Train Ride - When we visited the train was shut for some reason but we were able to walk on the tracks and reach the deer and peacock enclosures. As it was shut we were able to feed the deers cucumbers for the local vendors. 4. Kaneri Caves - It is a drive to reach the caves. We didn’t climb up but people who were completing their climb and returning said it took them 45 minutes to reach the top. 5. Other things - There are slides and play area for kids. There are lots of green spaces for kids to play freely. You can drive everywhere in the park. Car and each individual needs to buy ticket at the entrance. 6. Facilities - lots of restrooms in the park. Fairly clean. Lots of local vendors selling food for a quick bite. Overall a nice place for people of all ages. Would definitely recommend a visit.

Sanjay_Gandhi_National_Park,G A,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019,Sylvan Forest In Urban Mumbai,"SGNP or Borivali NP is a 108sq.m. real forest in the urban limits of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region.    I went there last Saturday, used to go almost every week in years past but with the ever increasing horrible traffic, the Metro road works and the overcrowded trains, it is a bit of a nightmare even thinking about travelling anywhere these days in Mumbai.  So now, its maybe 4 to 5 times a year if that.  I came mid September to see the wildflowers but the forest was shut then due to heavy flooding and damaged internal roads.   I hoped to see the wildflowers this visit but most of the colourful ones had dried out and the grasses were more predominant.  There also weren't as many butterflies as I had expected.  Anyway, a verdant forest is never disappointing and it was a good change from the hustle and bustle of the concrete jungle.A herd of spotted deer was foraging in one of the Adivasi settlements within the national park.  I went nearer and couldn't believe my eyes when I saw a lady feeding them from a thali!  She was very friendly and said the deer came almost every day for some leftover food.  She told me I could come nearer, but not too close as they were wary of strangers.  The deer, not the lady haha...The Adivasi people have always been living in this forest, originally deeper in the core area.  The forest department has resettled them in the public area and plans are afoot to resettle them out of the park entirely, which the Adivasis are protesting.  That aside, it was quite a thrill to see domesticated deer which made up for the lack of wildflowers.I decided to spend more time at the Kanheri caves which I will review separately.The fastest and cheapest way to travel to SGNP is by local train to Borivali East from where auto rickshaws are available to the main gate.  BEST buses also run from Borivali E station to Kanheri Caves base at certain times of the day.   From the ticket counter, you can walk or hire a cycle or drive through the park.  There are no restaurants, so carry your own food (there is a conveniently located Udipi restaurant across the road from the main gate) or eat the food that the Adivasis offer from their makeshift stalls along the road through the forest and at the caves base.  This is usually fruit, cucumbers and corn/ chana snacks along with lemon juice and on weekends there may be tea.    Avoid Sundays if you are looking for a peaceful experience as it gets excessively crowded.Forgot to mention that the national parks most famous inhabitant are the leopards,not that they are roaming around in the daytime for selfie moments with visitors, but they are very much there.  I saw a family of leopards near the Tulsi Lake (restricted area) some 15 years ago.  Deers are fairly easy to spot around the Adivasi padas and monkeys and langurs are a given.  Birds are aplenty though you need patience to see them through the dense foliage.  Comfortable walking shoes make the trip easier :-)It got rather warm during my visit, I had a had but I was sweating profusely.  December to Feb is good in the dry season and of course the monsoon months are magical.  September has the best of the weather, the streams, the flowers and the butterflies.Entrance and other rates are on the SGNP official website which also has details of events, how to book guided treks to restricted parts of the forest and other information.",0.9899,5

This park is one of the most visited parks in the world. This park is a popular tourist attraction. It is a vast park with caves and a big cat safari. There are 4 rivers originating from this park. There is a playground for children and a mini toy train. Also, there are a few shops inside the park and its forest is home to the Warli tribes. Had enjoyed the toy train ride to see the wild cats as a child. Earlier, the entry fees were less, but now they are a little on the higher side. One can visit the Kanheri Caves or go trekking on a small hill.This park is an ideal place for families, couples, school children, wildlife enthusiasts, nature lovers as well as friends. It is a must visit and should not be missed.",0.9787,5

Best way to visit this park is by cycling and best time to visit is rainy season. Park visiting fees is very nominal 58/- per person. Time to visit is around 7AM -5PM. As this place is very near to city so most of the wild animals are kept in zoo type safari hence no point of wasting time and money in safari. Cycling is amazing experience here you will see amazing greenery, water fall, river in entire national park. Only and biggest problem you will find that there is traffic jam inside park. People come by car bikes and ride them like normal roads which diminishes the beauty of park. Specially during weekends this places becomes very crowded. But yes still scenic beauty amaze you so well that you forget all these things. Cycling during rainy season might be little problematic for cloths but its more fun than problem.

Nice getaway from the hectic city-wild life! You’ll see deer, birds, monkeys. Meh:-caves close at 17:00! But park closes at 18:30. Be aware!-entry to caves and other tours have different prices for locals and tourists. So if you are a non-local you’ll pay about 7-8 times more. It’s not a major problem if you actually are a tourist since you probably have enough disposable income, but again, just be aware. Also, not sure how they really know if you are a tourist or not, especially if you’ve naturalised and can speak the language... anyways minor point-maps and signs are in the local language so don’t expect english or any other language.-they accept cash only! So plan ahead of time.-no public bathrooms except in specific spots ie caves and safari. So plan to take your break well ahead of time as well.Dislikes:-very dirty. Unfortunately there is a lot of trash everywhere, including things like plastic bags, bottles, shoes, paper, packaging, textiles, clothing and general rubbish. It’s really everywhere including areas where the wild animals roam. -there is a constant lingering odour of urine. After a half hour or so you get used to it, but in some places it’s much stronger.Thoughts:-Mumbai like much of India is a constrast of extremely wealthy and extremely poor living close together. Some areas of the park are also slums. So you’ll be confronted by this. It’s a part of Mumbai as a whole and the park is no exception-if you are expecting a national park in the same way you’d expect in Norway or France, you need to adjust your expectation. Despite this, it is a beautiful place with much diversity as Mumbai the city itself. See it in that light and you will enjoy it.",0.9164,5

Same with the bus safari, even over the weekend the buses were very less and hence the waiting time was longer than expected. No proper food arrangements in the campus. In the bus safari it was more of a ride than seeing animals.. Just saw one tiger after waiting for an hr.

There is a lot of walking involved so I would recommend not taking small children or very elderly people on the tour. If you have people of this age group in your party, there is plenty place for them to sit and relax while you go on the walking tour but please be advised that the walking tour will take more than a couple hours if you want to see all the caves. You can skip some part of it which could save you up to an hour. A lot of the caves are similar so if you see some of the smaller ones, you could typically skip most of the similar ones. There is one small restaurant but they don't serve a large variety of food so I would suggest carrying some light snacks if you want to eat.",0.9796,5

So we decide to turn back after a little break. Environment is a bit dusty and dry and in the beginning of the park is a whole (slobs)village, so not really fully nature but still some city feeling. However it was interesting to see all, also the 'wildlife': some deers searching for food near the houses.

The fare can be somewhere between 1000-1500 if you don't take a shared cab.Then you will be dropped to other counter where you will pay 60 rs per head to see the caged tigers but to see them you need to wait for the park authority bus. You need to stand in queue and wait atleast 20 mins for your turn, then your pathetic experience will start, where you will see caged area everywhere and if you are very fortunate then you will be able to see the tiger drom 100 mtr distance.

People eating kulfi, gola, bhutta, etc etc.. and throwing gola glasses, kulfi stick, eaten bhutta stick, polythene and all sort of waste anywhere on beach..very sad. Dustbin are very rare only with some food stalls. Every few steps on beach you will strike with a garbage thing. The situation is actually critical but no mumbaikar is worried about it.. as if Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has nothing to do with Mumbai.

We started with the Children museum to build that excitement to ignite their interest in other sections later.

The paintings, old Mumbai pictures. Skipped a few with kids not interested. The textile section was worth the visit. It's a spiral step that takes you to the higher floor. Very well displayed and described. Then the coins and jewellery and a new addition the Indian independence struggle keeping in mind the Woman of India. My elder son enjoyed the Mummy section while i entertained the younger one in the museum shop. Very well managed with security taking care of art and kids getting lost.

The heritage structures are in Victorian Neo-Gothic, Indo Saracenic, Renaissance Revival and Edwardian Neo Classical styles.We enjoyed the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya, formerly the Prince of Wales Museum. Considered one of the most significant museums in India, it is spread over three acres and includes more than 50,000 ancient artworks, sculptures and artifacts in its galleries. The museum is divided into three sections: art, archaeology and natural history.

It's not a big museum, not comparable to the MET (NY) or the V&A (London), not even the Indian Museum in Kolkata, all of which have way more Indian artefacts than this one does. But it was still an interesting experience and a good place to take children. And to hang out on a Sunday afternoon, which is what I did. The museum is open from 10 AM to 6 PM daily. Tickets cost INR 100 for Indian citizens, and an additional INR 100 If you want to take pictures even if it's through a phone camera. The museum has a main gallery and an extension gallery, the latter holding the more interesting exhibits, in my view. It can get hot and sweaty in the afternoon because most of the museums did not have AC. The best part about the museum is not so much the space itself but rather the events and exhibitions it frequently holds.

It was a flat walk and easy to do, especially after we learnt how to cross roads in India. We happily paid the foreigners visitors entry fee at the ticket office, just to the left inside the main gate (near the shop and cafe) and received our passes. We did not take an Audio Guide, as we like to view what we are interested in. We also like to take all the time we need to view the exhibits and we didn't hurry. We enjoyed viewing the gardens outside the exhibition building, especially the statues. We didn't pay extra to take photos inside and put our cameras away. We started by climbing to the top floor and found that on each floor, there is a corridor to an annex where there are more things to see. It is way easier to start at the top and walk down.  The Art, Archaeology and Natural History exhibitions include some of the oldest artifacts that I have ever seen. Some pottery pieces over 4,000 years old.

If one wishes to click photographs inside, one needs to purchase a separate camera ticket, which must be shown on request. The museum itself is spread on 3 floors and covers the whole gamut of Indian and world history from the prehistoric era to current day.The most eye-catching galleries for me were the Indus Valley civilization gallery, the Natural History gallery, European Painting gallery and the Far East gallery. While the former effectively conveyed the magnificence of the great civilization, the Far East gallery had a rich collection of items from Japan, China and South-East Asia. The European painting Gallery boasted of some amazing pieces of art and portraits.The Natural History gallery was the best of the lot. The variety of flora and fauna depicted here was simply amazing.

Without doubt you'll be hassled by people selling things but that's the case with any attraction, just be vigilant. If you go down the stairs to the entrance of the Dhobi Ghat you'll be greeted by people who want to give you a tour - they weren't pushy but it was Rs200 per person. We probably could have got this for less if we tried but it seemed a fair price. You need to be shown around by someone who knows the area given that you probably wouldn't find your way back out very easily! Definitely worth seeing if you have a spare half hour.  ",0.9803,5

Dhobi_Ghat,Ralph Wilhelm,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,"Stunning, one of a kind; must see to understand Mumbai","The Dhobi Ghat is best seen from the overpass that is on one edge of the Ghat itself.  It is not practical nor really needed to walk down into the Ghat; way too crowded and too many people working hard at cleaning and ironing clothes.  The city has created cement “steps” areas that the Dhobi’s use to clean clothes.  There also are slum type houses where the Dhobi’s live and also iron clothes, etc.  This is a vital part of the city that is required and used by many of the middle class and above to get clean and pressed clothes.  You would be able to see, but there is a middleman community that picks up dirty clothes from customers around the city in the morning, delivers them to the Dhobi Ghat, and returns clean clothes in the afternoon.Best time to visit would appear to be in the morning due to rush to turn clean clothes around.And from our tour guide who uses the Dhobis to clean her clothes, the cost is anywhere from ten cents to fifteen cents US to clean an article of clothing with an extra charge for ironing.This is a vital part of Mumbai that makes the city work and work well.

Haji_Ali_Mosque,prannnn,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2018 • Solo,One of the Main Attractions in Mumbai,"This is one of the prominent attractions in Mumbai and is considered as a holy place to visit for Muslims. The good part about this place they allow people from all religions to visit and although this place is open on all days, the best time would be during Ramadan. The place is located near the seashore and at a walk able distance from Mahalaxmi race course. You can reach here by public and private transportation. I would suggest you to prefer public transportation (Bus/ train - The nearest railway station is at a walk able distance) as they don't have any parking facility. Besides, being very prominent, the place is always crowded. Since its a religious place, you don't need to pay anything for entry fee, however you could always donate as per your wish. When you reach the sea shore, you need to walk along a narrow strip of land so as to reach the holy place and of course you have to go through security checks as well. The only issue with this place is the vicinity around the mosque as it has become very dirty and i hope the authorities would take some action in order to do a clean up for the sake of this iconic place.",0.9746,5

Nehru_Planetarium,AM,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2022,It was truly an out-of-the-world experience for just 150rs !!,"*It's going to be a long review. Visited the Mumbai Planetarium with my 4.5-year-old daughter. It was the first time for both of us. It started with me calling the inquiry number to confirm the timings, the person who attended the call and the gentleman at the ticket counter was really considerate and even helped us understand how to use the time we spent inside the auditorium well.He even guided us to visit the museum situated right opposite, till it was time for the show. It was amazing, so massive and gorgeous but we couldn't cover it entirely and had to leave midway for the show.The show presented by Mr. Rathore was impressive from the very beginning, he knew very well how to keep his audience enthralled throughout the show and his calm voice just made the show perfect. The main show is just exceptional from the way it was structured to the way it was presented using gorgeous high-quality videos and slides that were the best, making the audience go ""wow' almost every 5 mins.Trust me, if it's your first visit you won't remember much of what you hear informatively but you will most certainly keep visiting it visually and maybe be lucky enough to revisit it in dreams just as my daughter did. We came home with tons of pictures.It was beyond words!! My daughter is already planning her next visit and has started reading more about space ever since.All the staff, including the security guards, and the attendant at the canteen were polite and helpful and the place is very clean and well equipped with all the necessary facilities. Eagerly waiting to plan another visit on a Sunday soon for planet viewing through a telescope.

High_Street_Phoenix,Mustardseedy,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2019 • Friends,Beware of scammers,"The shopping centre is no doubt excellent with the choices of shops and the ambience. However, the toilets may be a little smelly and dirty especially on weekends. Some people may approach you selling bogus package and ask for money. Just be careful and walk away. Lastly, you will notice there are lots of taxis parked outside the shopping centre on both sides of the streets. They work as a team. Do not ever take those taxis as their taxi meters are modified and you will have to pay for your mistake. Don't believe? Try it for yourself. I have experience one incident today and noticed the meter jump by 10 rupees in just 5 seconds even the car was not moving. Checked Uber/ Ola and the fair was only 1/3 the price I have paid. 1000 rupees for a 20 minutes taxi ride? Doesn't make sense.

They have a different variety of cuisine and food in their food court. Worth to see if want to do shopping without bargaining and walking in the Rushy streets of Mumbai. But definitely nothing like the usual street experience in Mumbai. Mall is awesome but usually Crowded. It's too big as it might take almost one day if you need to visit all stores. Just ignore crowd and move on and enjoy the mall. Live music, fun activities many more events will be going on mostly on weekends.

The prices are extortionate and the service is rubbish. A main course of prawns only 4 on a plate...who are the feeding a cat?This restaurant is not fit to be called a restaurant.

High_Street_Phoenix,degrassihigh,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Couples,Tries its best,"If the aughts was the rise of Indian shopping malls and the footfalls it was to generate, the 2010s was the decline of some (e.g. Mulund Nirmal Lifestyle, now a shell of its former self, and also Thane).  Anyway, High Street Phoenix has survived and thrived and is popular with the masses.  Interestingly, I didn't see any Bollywood stars frequent the malls, nor any Lok Sabha or MLAs or any cricket players.  I did see lots of western brands but hardly any westerners!  Curiously I saw a politically correct family where the mother was white and her kids half-Indian (or Sri Lankan or Pakistani or Bangladeshi) in a store, so that was politically correct.  I also saw a young mother all stressed out (time of the month) with a child in pram yelling ""Excuse Me!!""  Quite uppity if you ask me.",0.4812,4

R_City_Mall,Munawar Karbelkar,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020 • Friends,Best place for Chinese ,"Whenever I think of Chinese, I think of mainland China they also had an advertisement which said if it's Chinese it's mainland China today. I went there with my best friend it was a treat from my side to her so it had to be the best Chinese in town and I'm happier that I selected mainland China. We ordered the following dishes and we had a ball : AppetizerJiang's chilly cottage cheese (veg) : This was the most creamiest and soft pioneer I've had in some time and the pairing of chilly with the paneer was to die for. This has been by far my favorite appetizer post the lock down Diced chicken with assorted pepper (nonveg) : Being a hardcore non vegetarian had to try a non veg appetizer and the diced chicken with pepper gave us the perfect Bang of taste and flavor. Corn & water chestnut dumpling (veg) : Water chestnuts are my favorite vegetables when I'm dining outside and finding any dumpling with water Chestnut in it my reviews will be biased. Loved it to the core. Go for itBasil flavored chicken dumplings (nonveg) : Great thin dumplings packed with flavor and gave a punch when we tried it with the chili oil sauce. Main courseSeasonal vegetables in smoked chilli sauce (veg) : This had the most exotic vegetables in it and the chili sauce was amazing I think this is the best veg main course I've had in an year at least this paired perfectly with the chicken fried rice was to die for. Chicken in roasted garlic sauce (non veg) : This was rich and creamy and had a great texture to it I loved every piece of the roasted garlic sauce that I had. Awesome. Rice & needlesBurnt garlic noodles with vegetables: These were soft and long noodles which worked perfect for a rainy day like we had today in Mumbai, the burnt garlic flavor was not overpowering, and it gave an amazing twist with the veggies. Chicken fried rice: Although it's a chicken fried rice but the taste it left dangling was out of the world and pairing it with the vegetables in chili sauce was a pair made in heaven. DessertHoney noodles with almond flakes : Not that I have never tried honey noodles before but if you are looking at the thinnest and the most crunchiest honey noodles give this one a shot. The almond flakes on top I did another element of crunch and was the perfect icing to the entire brilliant meal that I had Chocolate rolls : The chocolate lover in me had to order a chocolaty dessert and this ticked all boxes of being a perfect chocolate dessert. All in all if somebody had told me I this would be the entire menu and the taste I would have selected this without a second thought and so I would recommend each one of you to try this menu out. They maintain all the hygiene factors and ensure that safety is primarily during these covert times but at no point do they compromise on the taste definitely value for money and worth every penny that I spent My bestie had a big smile on her face.  Thank you mainland China .I thank the manager Pankaj for being extremely hospitable and this meal wouldn't have been complete without your suggestions and amazing attitude !",0.9982,5

The place has some very good rides, and many fantastic rides and a fabulous ""Wetlantic"" a large pool which also has waves at regular intervals. The park is divided into sections based on age and the children and adults can enjoy the day.The rides one must not miss are "" What a Coaster"", Black demon and the ""Bucket"" which empties once filled in the children's section, lazy river......There are many good food options in the park with the food being freshly prepared and served. There is also Fish Pedicure section (to be paid for additionally if required)Overall the park is a must visit and a great time to spend a day with family and friends. As we have visited Yas Waterpark in Abu Dhabi many times, I will say this park is on par with Yas Waterpark if not better. But always there is room for improvements and still can be worked on to be the Number One!!!",0.9957,5

It is situated in terrible location which is miles away from anywhere.  You have to catch a Ferry across which was very unreliable - depended on rain and tides.  We waited for two hours to get back across.  Very hard to communicate as we could not find a staff member that spoke decent English.  Rides are shabby and look like the need fixing,  water was absolutely filthy and Im talking brown!!!  Wave pool was slimy underfoot and very crowded.  So over all not a destination that I would recommend and is nothing like the water park in Bali called Water Bomb.",-0.3114,2

Water_Kingdom,vaibhavaero,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Business,Best for a reason,"I went here on a weekday with my office colleagues.This certainly is the best among the water parks I have been to. Clean water, decent crowd and nice ambiance.  But few things to take care (which made me give 1 less star).(1) Be very careful of the material you wear. I didnt exactly wear cotton as I knew most water parks do not allow cotton. But I was not allowed to take the slides. I had a bit of argument but that is ok. I do not consider it to be their fault. The material was not cotton but again, the topic was debatable. But what surprised me was that I was not allowed to take slides which use the big rubber tubes. It was annoying. When I asked about the reason, they could not explain. Obviously, it was a propaganda so that they could sell some stuff from their shops inside the park. I had to buy a synthetic pant to be able to take the slides.(b) We had pre-booked the food. The food was decent. But you could obviously get better stuff at the same price inside the park. I would suggest not to pre-book.Another suggestion would be to avoid going on weekends for 2 reasons (1) There is a lot of rush in the ferry and the park on weekends leading to a lot of wastage of time in waiting in queues for ferries and rides. (2) There are amazing offers on the weekdays, especially on tuesdays and fridays. You can visit a world class water park at less than the cost of visiting a local water park. In general, all the rides are amazing. Lot of options for food is available. You can even enjoy a drink or two as there is a bar available inside the water park.",0.9672,5

My advice is avoid going on Friday, you won't be able to enjoy lots of ride because of the crowd.Cost: normally 1050₹Tuesday:682₹Friday:525₹.Advisable: Book for Tuesday from cleartrip and apply promocode ""GOLOCAL"" which gives 10% off. I don't know whether the promocode will be valid when you use it.Total cost per person:Ticket cost+ 50₹ for ferry + Lunch cost 200₹+Locker 150₹.They have two lockers mechanical and electronic. In mechanical lock you have to pay 300₹. they return 150₹ when you give back the keys. In electronic there is no deposit fee. Just pay 150₹.Lockers can accommodate 1 back-bag and other small things like slippers and mobiles. water kingdom officially closes at 7pm.Advisable:Pack your things around 6pm. To avoid heavy crowd for ferry.If you reached gorai and now you are hungry. Go to humpty dumpty restaurant. It is a Indian, Chinese cuisine restaurant both veg and non-veg is available. Pocket friendly restaurant with good quantity and quality.Per person maybe 200₹ will cost you. You will go with happy memories and happy tummy.",0.9661,5

The shower area before you enter the park needs some access features as there are small steps here and there which cannot be avoided. But the entire park is absolutely wheelchair friendly. We able able to move around many places with a wheelchair except some of the really big rides. What we really needed was a separate toilet which was big and access friendly like those found in malls.  But the medical staff accommodated us and gave us their room for changing into fresh clothes.

Wankhede_Stadium,Anwer Dhanji,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2022,The best stadium in Mumbai for action and ambiance,This cricket stadium is the Indian version of THE THEATRE OF DREAMS.  Watched a cricket match. It is huge and the noise will make you get into action yourself even if you are an introvert especially if you are watching the IPL game. Can get very hot and humid,0.694,5
Wankhede_Stadium,TanD,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2022,Promises an incredible experience for cricket lovers!,"Overall experience: 5/5If you are in Mumbai and has the opportunity to watch a cricket match at Wankhede stadium, please do. It is sure to be an incredible memory! Things to know about the Wankhede stadium: Accessibility: 5/5 One of the most significant aspects of Wankhede stadium is its accessibility. You can reach the stadium via public transportation modes like local trains and cabs. Gate no.4, the entry for the Sachin Tendulkar Stand, is located just outside the Marine Lines local train station, making it the most convenient. Stands: 5/5Almost one-third of the seats are in the Sachin Tendulkar stand. This is one of the most exciting places to be if you want to experience the energy and enthusiasm of the cricket fans fully. As I have been here, I can vouch for the quality of the experience here. Also, most parts of this stand has a roof on top. This makes the heat tolerable during the summers in Mumbai for daytime matches.Avoid the Divecha stand and some front rows of the Vengsarkar stand if you are going for a daytime match as you would be in direct sunlight, and it can be an uncomfortable experience for you. Seats: 3/5The seats are just fine in comfort and are well-maintained and tidy. The only con is that it might get uncomfortable for you and the people sitting next to you if you are a chubby person as the seats are close together.The spacing between two rows is quite a lot, which means that even if a six-foot person in the next row stands up, your view will not be blocked. Visibility: 5/5No matter where you book your tickets, you can clearly see the players, the bat, and the ball. This is worth mentioning because I thought the experience might not be great if you purchase a low-cost ticket and sit in L3 or at the end seats. The videos and photographs online do not do justice to the actual experience. Pricing: 4/5The ticket pricing varies based on the demand, placement of the seats, and other facilities. It is up to you how much you want to spend. On weekdays, you will come across tickets starting at Rs.800 for IPL matches. Weekends will always be slightly more expensive than weekdays and would start around Rs.1200.Food and drinks: 4/5Any outside food and drinks are an absolute no-no at the stadium. You get free water in the stadium in small paper cups. You can carry them onto the seating area. But the chances of you spilling that and making a mess are pretty high. The food and drinks sold at the match area are reasonably priced. You get around 200ml cool drink for Rs.50, cold coffee for Rs.100, popcorn for Rs.100, etc. While they cannot be called ""affordable"", they are way cheaper than what you find in cinemas and other entertainment facilities in Mumbai. They are also decent quality. Washroom Cleanliness: 2/5The washrooms were neat and clean before the commencement of the match. But it gets dirty over a period as hundreds of people use it. There is no one to clean and it and can be a terrible situation for you if you are in the stadium for a long-form cricket match.",0.9668,5

Many of the reception staff were the same and gave us a friendly return welcome. The rooms are still well maintained and food ever so tasty and superb value. The Club has a good café which offers a range of delicacies and three different restaurants on site, all of good value and offering a range of dishes that you never really feel you need to venture out of the club to eat. There is an outdoor pool available for residents and guests of the club.  The club has a good hair salon on the 3rd floor that offers a range of services, which was good to use.  The club remains a favourite of ours and is excellently located just off Marine Drive. My only disappointment was that the WIFI remains weak and after a few minutes connection is lost and you have to log in again.  If we return again time hopefully this would have improved.   Please note you can only stay at this club if you are a club member or a guest of a member.  It is not 5 star luxury but for the price, comfort, location and service, it is a pleasure to stay at.

Met Sunil @ JUICE, Phoenix Mall and he recommended Cysteine treatment. Went for a short trim to straighten out my splits (yes, that too was a bother) and then went for Cysteine. The whole procedure lasted for about 3 hours, from hair wash to cut to treatment. The gel/ cream is left on overnight and had to go back for a wash the next day (no inconvenience here as hair looks wet, washed and oiled). Post hair wash on Day 2, also opted for hair colour and yes, walked out of the saloon feeling like a new person.Now, after 3 weeks am still enjoying frizz free hair.

Infiniti_Mall,SanjayPunjabi,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2022,"So yes, go for it. But one experience is sufficient to last a lifetime.","#sanjayrestaurantreviewalert Mainland China, Infinity Mall, MaladMainland China, owned by Anjan Chatterjee’s Speciality Restaurants Limited (Haka, Hoppipola, Machaan, Sigree Global Grill, Oh! Calcutta, Zoodles, Riyasat, Episode One) is a fine dining Chinese restaurant, and apparently doing a great job of it.This location at Malad Infiniti Mall is a large estate, however, the ambience turned out to be below average. The seating arrangement was cluttered and with an odd layout – they seemed to have made a mess of it. Jostles, accidental dropping of fares by the servers, a clunky billing counter in the middle of the area open for everyone to have a gallery view of it – not working.Food wise they are good, not offering the absolute premium stuff but not peddling the absolute basic fare either. The Chicken in Roasted Garlic sauce (525) had a nice aromatic air around it, a good number of chicken pieces dunked in a garlicky sauce, not too spicy, just the way I like it. So was the Ginger and Capsicum fried rice (475) with tiny bits of capsicum and ginger juliennes sufficiently spicing up the fare. Overall the meal was light and fluffy, not overwhelming you with its weight, and at the same time delighting your palate.So yes, go for it. But one experience is sufficient to last a lifetime.",0.9618,5

These points accumulate to get u into various status like blue, silver, gold n platinum.. each tire gives u benefits like free parking, movie tickets, shopping assistant etc..I like the best thing about movie tickets.. with gold tier u get 2 movie tickets every quarter while the platinum tier gets 4 tickets every month.. I am not sure whether this is advertised much but it is one of the best programmes in malls where we anyway go shop and spend money.. then why not earn points and get some free movie tickets n parking as well.. but mind you this is good for those people who frequent this mall otherwise no benefits as such..Currently they are running 3x points and its very lucrative..So if u live near this mall or frequently shop from here, go for this benefit..",0.9813,5

Some of the work is extraordinary good. There is diversity of medium and I was fascinated recently by an artist that worked solely with copper - his skill was unimaginable. One hall only gave me a bad a experience - one of the staff with rottweiler mentality at anyone who pointed a camera in the direction of their artwork . Small mindedness has no place in art and we should all share what we know. I was a little worried visiting other galleries and decided to break the ice with the artist. Tell them I loved their work and could I take their photo next to it. Flattery will get you everywhere - even a free book from each of the galleries on their art on display. I love this place. The rules on photography are general. If you want to photograph the artworks feel free to chat with the artist and ask. Allow an hour here for all galleries. You have to pay to use the toilet here, but if you can wait the Prince of Wales Museum and the Modern Art Museums both have free toilets - and better cafes. This is well worth a visit.

The main residents, it seems, all work at jobs outside of the slum and rent these spaces to the newly arrived, who earn a fraction of what the long term residents earn on the outside. So, are we to believe that life is good here? It is a crowded metropolis of people struggling to earn a living.

This slum has over a million residents, which that number alone is hard to comprehend.We saw the places where the people lived, some of the work they do, and how they live their daily life. Incredible and unimaginable. The recycling businesses going on there are quite industrious, as well as other businesses such as pottery making and leather goods.The rooms where some of the people live are located on alleys that are full of holes and are narrow and dark. We saw inside some of the rooms, very small considering the average family size.This, to me, represents a large part of what the real India is like. Everyone should take this tour.

Dharavi,MWandAW,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2020,This reality has some hope,"My wife and I had a guided tour of this area with a local youth leader and the things that they are doing there are truly inspirational. As you visit, you see industry in motion. No-one is sitting around feeling sorry for themselves. They are all active. The children were in school with their teachers. The women were washing clothes, shopping for groceries, selling food in the markets. The men and boys were building new walls on houses, digging drains, collecting plastic, paper, cardboard and metal and bagging it in batches, to take to recycling plants. So much happening down every street and alleyway. Small cars, motor bikes and scooters bustle around the small lanes, our group often had to jump out of the way, to let them through. The area is alive with a beating heart of industry with people clawing out a meager existence any way they can. They are at the bottom of the caste system and they are doing the best they can. The local youth workers help the children to seek higher education, even to University. Life is hard there, but they just get on with it. The Mumbai Local Government does clean the streets, but the sheer number of people with little understanding of public cleanliness, drop paper and bags of rubbish wherever a place exists. There are no fines, people can't pay. Littering is a big issue in this environment and the blocked drains are a continuous problem that needs addressing. They said it is a very slow process, but education about not littering is underway. It may take a few years, but it will happen. We were just shocked at the smells of mountains of litter that adorn that whole settlement. We visited some of the industries, including textile production and the tanning process and the making of handbags and leather coats from goat hides. We visited a leather shop attached to a tanning factory with good quality items being made and sold, inside the settlement. It will never end, it seems. The government are moving people to their own flats on a regular basis, though the area seems to rebuild itself with more people. A visit to see this part of Mumbai is a real eye opener and is recommended, but not for the feint-hearted.",0.6479,5

A real eye opening, humbling experience that was no doubt the highlight of our Indian trip.Seeing how the locals works and live puts everything into perspective as a privileged Westerner. The people were so warm and welcoming. Not once did I ever feel uneasy or threatened or anything like that.

Our guide, Neil, was excellent and able to explain how life works, having lived there himself. It was a moving and humbling experience seeing people working long hard hours for just £4 or £5 a day, sleeping in rooms above their factory. Recycling, machining, leather, pottery, etc. It's not a tour for the faint hearted and you need to be fairly agile and have good footwear, but it's another example of an experience of India that leaves you a slightly different person.

The tour was good, it was great to have a real insight in to everything they did here. These people work hard and it shows and are really proud of the work they do and so they should. We seen bags, belts, wallets all magnificently made to perfection. And when I done research on these products high manufacturers and company’s across the world buy these products from the slums and sell them at a really astronomical prices were in Dharavi they get just enough to get them. I’ve seen kids here with no shoes, iPhones, iPads or toys literally just playing with gravel stones and they’re the happiest kids I’ve seen in my entire life. People always perceive the people living in the slums to have “nothing” yet their the happiest of people, so to me they’ve everything. Coming here for me, I wanted that humble moment but unfortunately I didn’t get it. 👀 But it showed me everything in a sense you can have all the money in the world, and go on exquisite holidays and still feel unhappy about life or yourself. Everyone wants to prove they’ve been somewhere like you can’t take a photo of a statue nowadays cause you need to be in the photo to prove you’ve been there. Yet here in the slums you’ll only see hard work, love and laughter. No phones, iPads. And I think it’s incredible something I haven’t seen in a very long time. From all my traveling around India I felt extremely safe here in the slums. Parts of India you’ll feel alien really, you’ll get the odd stares here and there but at the slums, nothing. Going in to some factories the men working were happy to show you what they were working on.Definitely worth a visit for whatever reason or whatever reason you might feel will help or humble you.

It was such an incredible time to really challenge the view society holds on poverty.  Yes, it exists, but the industry, culture and innovation that lives here is outstanding.  Leather, plastic, cloth, aluminum, markets, schools, bakery, hospital, it's all here.  We didn't get to see all of it, but we saw a good portion.  You need to go with a guide as there are places that you do not go as it is not respectful to just wander around in some areas, you actually interfere with their life (day to day and their industry, they are very busy working).  Pick a tour that speaks to you--we chose one that supports university students, although we were disappointed to find out the ""student"" wasn't in school any longer and hadn't been for a few years.  I would instead choose one that supplies school needs (supplies) to the children. If you simply google, a few options will come up (that's why I am reviewing the slum and not the company).  It is a very, very busy place, it exists like a separate city.  You are not able to take pictures inside, but you can stand on the bridge that enters the slum and take some pictures looking down into it.  There is a leather goods store that makes and sells higher-end leather goods such as jackets and purses etc. and we were able to take a few pictures outside of there, but that is about it.  We were pleasantly surprised by many aspects of the slum, and I would not hesitate to go back  Definitely put this on your list.",0.9709,5

It is eyeopening to see the resilience of the residents living in small tight living quarters but still remain happy and positive as they all share a community spirit of togetherness!To see innovative recycling cottage industries where nothing is wasted and everything turned into saleable goods is an art only found in India!!,0.9828,5
Dharavi,Ralph Wilhelm,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2019 • Couples,"One of top five highlights in ALL of India, a MUST","Yes, you will be surprised, totally.  But visiting Mumbai and NOT visiting Dharavi is a shame and a huge hole in your education.  Many tour companies are set up for taking groups of five to seven tourists on a walking tour of Dharavi.  They typically hire local residents who live and work in Dharavi to be your face to face tour guides:  amazingly capable and talented people who will answer all your questions.  Yes, Dharavi residents grow up, go to school through college and work and continue to live in Dharavi.Promise that this tour will break many of your preconceptions about a “slum” as the Indian citizens call it.  Amazingly dense, typical housing of 100 to 150 square feet per FAMILY UNIT, common and central (many) toilet facilities, half of area focused on housing residents to live and the other half focused on industry (recycling, value added manufacturing, leather goods from raw hides to finished goods for sale at very fair prices, etc.Please make time for this adventure and DON’T come with your prejudices, come with an open mind to learn, to ask questions, to understand, to interact, to see a part of Mumbai that is critical to their success.All of us on our tour were moved and impacted in positive ways by this tour.

It was really interesting to see how this place functions.  Ahad also told us that the money generated from these tours helps to pay university fees for the youngsters.

So when a friend who was visiting India for the first time suggested we do the tour, I decided to join him. I must say that it was two of the most fascinating and eye opening hours that I have ever spent! Dharavi is a 'city within a city', fully functioning with industrial areas (such as the famous plastic recycling), residential areas, retail, schools and hospitals/medical centres. Crime is minimal and mafia do not control Dharavi. It has Hindi, Muslim and Christian communities living and working together. The kids in the slums looked happy and energetic. Some of the sights in the residential areas showed how tough the living conditions can be and we in the west should take note of how these amazing slum communities seem to just get on with what they have got and live their lives.

The recycling businesses, the potteries, the leather and the textile side. I imagine the stews in London in the 19C would have been similar to the area minus the humidity and heat.  The area didn’t smell and everyone was clean and neatly turned out. We could peer quickly into everyday chores of the women in their kitchens and talk to the workers via Ganesh. There are 32 slums in Mumbai and this is the largest.... it is a hive of activity, everyone works and the turn over is $1 billion a year from an estimated 5,000 businesses in an area of 0.7 sq miles.

Not going to say too much on it, but yes of course it is eye-opening and confronting in many ways when you absorb the information, but also there is much to admire and respect in what is a high functioning, industrious and supportive community. It’s a city within a city. What I will say is it is very safe and no-one asks for money or tries to sell you something you don’t want (although you do end up in one of the leather shops, as you might expect!), so you are left to focus on the place itself rather than watch yourself and that makes it all the better.

We visited one of India's largest slums, the area made famous by Slum Dog Millionaire. The area is home to 1 million people at a density of 570,000 people per square KM!It was such an uplifting experience, and slum is just a word. This place is amazing and Australia could learn an enormous amount about how to deal with our waste. Firstly, Mumbai has banned single use plastic bags for the entire population of 26 million people (and we complain when Shops take bags away).So what we saw was thousands of small scale industries based almost entirely on recycling. They purchase the plastic and metal wastes of almost the entire city. They break the materials down to all their components etc. Plastic is graded and sorted then chopped up into tiny pieces. As an aside, they need machines to chop up the plastic. Solution, one factory makes the machines using the steel from old train wheels. They melt the steel and cast it on site. (This factory covers an area of about 20m x 20m). After the plastic is graded and chopped they then melt it and cast it into little pellets which are then sold to manufacturers to making the next product. Nothing is wasted, and puts us to shame.Aluminium is sorted, and melted down to ingots which again are sold to industry. Old paint cans are cleaned, repainted, fixed up and resold to industry for new paint products. Cardboard boxes are cleaned, cut down to a new size and sent to industry for the next product. It is hard to describe, but this area converts the waste of 26 Million people back to raw materials for another round. The economy of this ""slum"" is enormous in comparison to the business district. Almost everyone has a job or role, and they are making a positive difference by changing waste to money and raw products.If in Mumbai you really should do this tour. Extremely informative and changes perspectives.P.S. They hated the movie. It in no way reflects the reality of this amazing place and wonderful people.PPS. You can't take photos inside.

The original temple was first built in former Bori Bandar area near the Victoria terminus in 1675. But it was destroyed in 1737. Another temple was built in Bhuleshwar in 1739.  Mumba devi was the patron Goddess of Agri (salt collectors) and Kolis (Fishermen), the original inhabitants of the seven islands of Bombay. The word “Mumba” was derived from two words “Maha” and “Amba”, which means “great mother.” The fisher men regarded her as their protector and as ‘Maha Shakti”. The temple is located in Mumba Devi Road near Zaveri Bazaar. It is a narrow street with many stalls selling pooja material like flowers, fruits, copper bracelets, brass lingams, rings etc. The temple is open on all days except Monday. In the sanctum one can see shrines for Ganesh, Hanuman, Shanishwara, Krishna with Radha and Annapurna. The main Goddess is a 3.5 foot high red sandstone idol smeared with sindur. She is decked with a silver crown, a nose stud and a gold necklace. In front of her, a lion made of stone is seen. According to legend, Brahma created Mumba devi (an eight-armed goddess) to fight and vanquish a demon called “Mumbaraka who harassed pious people. The defeated demon requested her to stay here and have the name of “Mumba Devi.” The Goddess agreed and stayed there. Mumbaraka constructed a temple there and worshipped her. The temple timings are from 6.00 a.m to 9.00 a.m and from 12.00 to 9.00 p.m. Aarti is given both in the morning and evening. The nearby tourist places are Zaveri Bazaar, Crawford Market, and Chowpatty Beach at the northern end of the Marine Drive.

Prithvi_Theatre,SalimM,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Worth it,We were keen to watch a play while in Mumbai. So when we saw a comedy play advertised we jumped at the chance and booked our tickets. Staying at Nariman Point meant a long drive on New Years Eve all the way to Juhu. We had been warned that you do not get allocated seat numbers so get there early. The drive was nearly ninety minutes and when we got there there was already a long queue. We joined in and after some time the doors opened and we slowly made our way in. The theatre is small and seating is circular and such that it's up-close to the performance stage. We were lucky to see some empty space on the benches at the far end and we rushed over. Seats are usually sold out as most of the plays/performances are popular. Within minutes the theatre was packed. After a few minutes the play started. It was funny and a real experience. All in all well worth it. The journey back to Nariman Point at about midnight with new years celebrations in full swing was quite something.There is a cafe outside which seems to be the hang out place to be seen. It was packed with young people. They have a nice line in parathas and shakes. Give them a try if you can find a space to sit.,0.9705,5

Over 500 shows are staged throughout the year from Tuesday to Sunday every week.We visited this place last Saturday with the aim of seeing a play and then having a meal at the Prithvi Cafe. No photographs can be taken inside the theatre premises and thus the only photograph being uploaded is of the outside noticeboard. Outside the theatre proper is a cute lil bookshop which provides one adequate books on theatre. The Prithvi Cafe is also located on the complex which was full of the young crowd.

Prithvi_Theatre,SangElixir,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Solo,"Prithvi times, changing!","Mumbai a mercantile, port city, had the earliest entertainment avenues of music(mujra, baithak, dance schools etc), theatre(natak, nrityanatak, street plays etc) and then there started the era of silent movies, talkiies....as they say rest is history. Among these many many options one man created history for this city and I dare say for this country- Mr Prithvi Raj Kapoor, baritone voice, massive stage presence, volition to create quality work, entourage working tirelessly following his footsteps. He took theatre to the people. His theatre company staged plays across the length n breadth of this vast country and then one day his legacy got a permenant address called the Prithvi Theatre.It's not just an experimental theatre but it's also a catalyst among actors, writers, artistes, onlookers just about everyone whose life it touches. Information about Prithvi theatre can be found from many online sources, whereas this review is to give a worm's eye view of this small location which has been a bedrock of an art movement.If you go to Prithvi you can watch a play, enjoy some coffee, eatables, strike up conversations with complete strangers.... In case no play is running you can still enjoy all of the above minus chaos of human turbulence, in one corner you might see a group heartedly arguing over something, another corner someone might be plucking some tunes, or playing a flute and people like me would just be sipping, soaking, enjoying in silence.Over last two decades it has changed a lot. Prithvi is now a lot lot more in fashion then it was earlier. It's difficult to get tickets now. Years back I remembers seeing plays by just walking in last minute. Now one has to book in advance. Now the place is crowded most of the times, earlier it was a quiet, secluded, shady, warm spot.Prithvi being an experimental theatre you can expect literally all formats of storytelling going on there. A performance, a monologue, song n dance, repertoire...list is endless. Seating is amphitheare types, so you better come 15 minutes before the play starts n get in the queue to enter the performance hall.In case you don't want to watch a play, meet strangers, have coffee etc you can just drop by and savour the history narrated on the walls of the foyer, anteroom... The old black n white pictures, historical tidbits of the theatre movements, it's a treat to the eyes and the soul!There are many players now, but the plays are every bit as great.",0.9893,5

Prithvi_Theatre,crossworlds,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016,For the love of all things theatrical...," If are a theatre buff, a visit to Mumbai would be incomplete without a stop at Prithvi Theatre, so lovingly created by thespian Prithviraj Kapoor and nurtured by his son, Shashi Kapoor, and his family. There is a sense of romance in watching a play put up on the small, intimate stage where viewers in the front rows can actually reach out and touch the actors, who often incorporate impromptu lines about the here and now, talking directly to the audience in a way that makes you feel you're part of the action. But be sure to reach well in time because ticket rates are uniform, seating is free (you queue up and sit on a first-come-first-bag-a-place basis) and most players are sticklers for punctuality. And for silence, so beware if an errant mobile has not been muted before play time! You might be shamed into doing so by irate actors who are skilled enough to make the rebuke sound like a piece of dialogue. The air-conditioning is very strong inside, so do carry something to shield againt the blast. It helps to buy the tickets in advance, especially when popular groups or actors are scheduled to perform. But even if you can't catch a play - or drop in on a Monday or a rare day when none is scheduled - just soak in the sheer atmosphere, colour and character of the place. You could browse through the shelves of the charming onsite bookshop that can yield rare nuggets if you search persistently. Or settle down on one of the curious low seats at the Prithvi cafe, treat yourself to its famous Irish coffee and a plate of munchies... and gawk; this is a popular haunt of the famous, the almost-famous and the vaguely familiar wannabes. Especially during Prithvi theatre festival, a must-do on the cultural calendar of any lover of the performing arts.",0.9937,5

I wanted to see the flower market but that happens much earlier and sellers are finished by the time tourists appear. So I had to settle for fresh produce and the general offerings on the street and shops we passed. The countless sellers sell everything from face washers ( i bought one to mop up perspiration - hot and humid) to fashion, leather goods, makeup and a mind-blowing range of items including cookware. It is a bustling market with locals buying here.  The prices were very reasonable and quality good.  My guide's advice on which stalls were reliable was useful.  I wish I had bought more but weight and luggage are always a problem.  It was fun exploring this market and i especially loved the quality of their fruit and nuts and dried fruit. It was Diwali so I bought a couple of lovely boxed fruit and nuts - freshly packed as you wait.

A friend of us suggested a place called the ""Chor Bazar"". While not unheard of by me, I was taken aback by the assurance of this friend of mine that I will find what I need over there. Me and Vivek (the project buddy) took a long drive from Andheri to South Mumbai, and finally reached the hallowed ground - the Crawford Market area (which is a lively fruit wholesale market by the wee hours of morning, and a front for the Chor Bazar, by the afternoon). Vivek and me parked at one of the many pay-n-parks around the location, and began our adventure on foot. While we eventually found our way to the many lamp dealers in the market, we were also greeted my honestly fascinating odds and ends all over the place. Home decor, electronics and dinner-sets galore - everything was unique to say the least.

Some touts sell duplicate international brand perfumes on roadsides, so take care if you are dealing with them.

The salesman kept flopping down prepackaged masalas....i wanted whold spices....so after the third time i asked him about cardamom he finally gave in.  I compared some of the prices with a visit at a previous market and he kept telling me what i got wasnt real or not organic.  I asked, how do I know your stuff is organic....he couldnt answer.I think I got a little taken....but i think he knew I knew what i was talking about.Finally our guide took us to the animal portion where there were baby ducks in cages and turtles etc...and then saw a man beat a dog with a stick.  He lead ua through the fruits section where we wanted some ohotos but he was rushing us along.  Then after three attempts to get us to look at pashminas (already bought some in a factory up north), he got frustrated and lead us to the door and asked for a tip.My partner asked ""you said we didnt have to?""""You dont if you didnt enjoy your time""I replied....""we didnt"" he threw his hands in the air and marched off.We were prepared for a two hour meander but were in and out in 25 mins.Had a much better experience for spice shopping at G W KHAMKAR SPICES (KHAMKAR MASALA)",-0.3274,2

Baadshah restaurant is the place to eat even if you have to wait for 15-20 mins.7. It will take atleast three days to roam around the entire market. So make a priority list and shop likewise.8. Depending upon weather, carry enough sun protection, wear cotton clothes and drinking water.9. If in a group, try to stay together. Sometimes the mobile network goes bad and noisy atmosphere will make your ringtone not audible.10. Secure your personal belongings and valuables.It is a really good place.

A weekday is good though you will still see a lot of people. The market has so much to offer. There are rows of cosmetics shops offering all the good brands at discounted prices. The covered part of the market across the road has a large number of dry fruit shops and candy shops. A large variety of candy, imported biscuits and chocolates, coffee are available at wholesale prices.

Crawford_Market,AucklandWiz,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018,Came To EXCELLENT SPICES As Part Of A Tour But Beware,"We visited this market as part of a tour we were doing for the day.

It wasn't until we got back to the car and realised what we had paid was too much but was too late to do anything about it. The guide spoke to the EXCELLENTSPICES stall by phone and they said their prices had gone up since last month which is a crock of bull. So be very wary of pricing and go with an idea of pricing in mind. Since I have complained to the tour company the guide worked for and they were going to meet with him and also refunded us the price of the spices. I think the guide was on the take for taking tourists there. Since we have been to Kerala and Sri Lanka and yes, I can confirm that Excellent Spices are a rip off. We should have been payng about 1/3 of what he charged us.Other than this there was a big variety of very nice looking fruits etc and good photo opportunities with the buildings age and the colours.

One plus point is availability of parking space within the premises - something that is very important here considering small lanes in this area. The temple is different from other temples in the sense that it focuses on Krishna consciousness and has a number of sketches on events in Krishna's life. There is a counter where a lot of books are available. It also has a good restaurant 'Govinda' where one can have food.,0.6478,5

One of the prime reason is its close proximity to juhu beach. Many of the visitors tend to visit the temple before going for a stroll in the beach which is just walking distance away. As far as parking is concerned, the temple has space for that but the roads leading to the temple is very narrow and very congested. The temple opens during morning and evening (around 4:30 pm) and is very peaceful compared to outside city life. In case want to get peace of mind, then this would be a good choice. inside the temple, they even have snack counters as well and one restaurant (Govinda) and all of them server only vegetation foods. The best time to visit the temple would be during janmashtami wherein they conduct a lot of pujas and the place would be decorated very beautifully.",0.9878,5

I learned how to swim, play tennis, badminton, golf (not very enthusiastically or well, at the behest of my golf-mad father), steal a kiss, and flirt with my pubescent playmates at the Willingdon, or as its known to its denizens, simply “The Club”.Its not that there are no other clubs in Bombay, but it’s the only one which does not require a qualifying proper noun to identify it. Going to the Club was a perfectly well understood and acceptable teenage activity as far as parents were concerned, and they probably thought it was solely for the sports and athletics. But it also served as cover for romantic adolescent endeavors. There was a bit more license to cavort with members of the opposite sex at the Club, than in the outside world, as it was understood that they were socially acceptable as girl friends or mates, that our parents and relatives knew each other. However, it also made for a small world, where everyone one met knew everyone else one knew. So this freedom did impose some behavioral restrictions. Nothing stayed secret from parents very long, but the experimentation was generally viewed somewhat benignly. On balance, a plus.The facilities are top notch, catering as it does to the elite of Bombay society, as it has done since it was established, over a century ago.  It continues to provide a serene oasis, a refuge from the cacophonous hustle and bustle of commerce in the undisputed hub of business life in India. The extremely large grounds, which encompass a golf course, numerous tennis, squash, and badminton courts, many buildings and facilities, a plethora of restaurants and cuisines, are unique in a city where each square foot of land is prized and rare. The demeanor of the service staff has lost some of the dignified bearing i remember from many decades ago. However, the food is simply the best, justly renowned, and is only rarely improved upon by any of the many restaurants in town. A meal on the verandah, overlooking the lawns and golf course is one of my pleasures while visiting Bombay. And an akoori on toast, accompanied by chocolate cream in a glass of Coca Cola (known to the staff as a coke float) is my de rigeur breakfast following a morning swim. Can’t be beat!The membership rolls, always exclusive, have been closed since 1985, except to the children of a member; so the only way to enter the Club is as the guest of a current member, or as a member of one of several reciprocal clubs around the world. If while in Bombay, you have an opportunity to visit the Club, you will be  glad you did, as it harks back to a bygone era of unhurried elegance, old world Colonial charm, and gracious living.",0.9974,5

I think only the member can get it, ie.you can't bring guests who are not members of a reciprocal club. You would think it was about the early 40s. The Raj was in it's twilight, but nothing has changed here. It's kind of like watching a retro movie set in Eton or an Oxbridge college in the 1930s (I wish I could have photographed the dressing room the golfers use). The surroundings are exquisite. The verandah is a delightful place for drinks and snacks. The great and the good of Bombay are here (never use that M-word name, but especially not here). Lots of Parsee ladies in slacks and blouses with exquisite jewellery. Slightly spoilt little Bombay madams using Daddy-ji's card and sipping daintily from huge mugs of beer. Welsh rarebit, all-day breakfast (with BACON available) and all lovely Raj type food on the menu. Live music, nothing post 1948 was played. Great value drinks and food in a very relaxed, up-market atmosphere. Membership closed in the 1980s, only children of current members can get membership.

But, unfortunately some well travelled committee members had other ideas, and so was born the Maratha-Greco monument , I'm sure to make good on the Persian destruction of the older Parthenon in the invasion of 480 BC.Cudos to the wisdom of these members to erect a monument that houses badminton and squash courts. I hope they see fit to install sculptures, some of which now reside in the British Museum, The Acropolis Museum and the Louvre ( if they need further inspiration, though my gut tells me they've figured this one out ).This is an example of how a group of people can collaborate to destroy the sanctity of a place in the misguided belief that building a monument to ones-self makes things better......an unfortunate new reality in Mumbai.Hopefully, our younger and clearly more sophisticated membership will be galvanized to take action and a leadership role on these committees so tragedies like this do not continue to befall this beautiful place  (e.g. a helipad on the golf course/ a zipline over the tennis courts/ a petting zoo on the front lawn/ bumper cars on the putting green etc. )And then there's the disaster affectionately referred to as the upstairs Dining Room. An impossible place. Wires protruding out of a stark wall. Reverberating noise. No sound dampening interventions at all ( they ....... "" the committee""......they have one for everything, actually paid someone to design this ). The food tumbles out of the kitchen in a random fashion ( our meat was uncooked and was sent back ), and perplexed wait staff trying to do their best.This club needs a major overhaul. The young, educated and progressive membership needs to get active and save this place before it becomes a jumbled mess. Maybe someone will have the courage to lead the club back to its former glory, rather than the garish monstrosity that's emerging from these hallowed grounds.Bruised egos' apart, I hope the collective membership in this bright future doesn't forget its past, and the Grande Olde Dame of Bombay is honoured in a way that is appropriate to her history.",0.9948,5

In a manner as one is pleased by cucumber sandwiches and lemonade at the Gore Hotel In London overlooking the weather.   The old wicker and cushions ""Verandah"" cafe stands alongside a desultory 9 hole golf course. The food and service is delightfully old world, and tasty, the little bells at every table to call for service is quaint if a bit tasteless in this modern age. The library and restaurants can be very discreet and quiet on a week day so perfect to conduct a business meeting or a private tete-a-tete. Endless corridors between venues remind you of boarding school in Panchgani - walk tall, tread lightly, lots of old memsahibs about fitting into their weak tea.  The facilities are quite sumptuous- a good sized swimming pool, a lovely panelled bar, even a grocery shop. An air of old money and exclusivity hangs over the club that stopped taking in members in 1985, and only permitted female nominees in 2007. Honestly, it's getting a bit stale - hence the emergency cash infusions from corporate memberships and well-heeled expats. Expect an old and formal and robust admissions panel interview. Before they cash your generous cheque. Do visit. Do enjoy the old world hospitality. The last bastion of the Empire will die on the subcontinent.",0.9826,5

I visit Bombay about once a year, but always for short trips and one of the ways of meeting as many of my friends as possible to catching up with them one evening. Last year my buddy with whom I was staying arranged dinner here, and last week when I was back, we had an encore. The club is an oasis amid busy & crowded Bombay and of course one needs to be a member or a guest of one to visit. It is named after one of the Viceroys of India, and the whole place is in a wonderful time warp. The most amazing part is the mens loo, called the ""Gentlemans Dressing Room"" which can serve as a set for any film set a 100 years ago. There are some amusing sights you will see if you venture in!We ate at the bar which serves a wonderful version of  quintessential Indian club snack, masala peanuts, a concoction of peanuts, chills, tomatoes, onions, lime juice & salt. We also had chilli paneer, chill chicken, salt & pepper prawns and kathi kebabs. They serve the full board of drinks, but my favourite is what I call a ""Gautam"" Mary, which is a virgin mary, served in a whiskey glass, with the salt inside & not on the rim, made extra spicy.My wonderful buddy who arranged this paid the bill (!) so don't know exactly how much it was, but going by normal club fare in India, it would be U$15 per person,Cant wait to be back there again.",0.9886,5

You have to qualify to be a member though and the rules and conditions are many and varied. Once you get past those, then you're king !

Popular clubs around Mumbai city are CCI club, Bombay Gymkhana, WIAA club, Breach Candy Club, Bandra Gymkhana, Khar Gymkhana, Willingdon Gymkhana, Chembur Golf Club, etc. Of all these, I consider the Willingdon Sports Club at Mahalaxmi to be the swankiest, most exclusive, best dressed club in the city. This place is a second home to Mumbai's crème-de-la-crème. You'll find the city's millionaires, top level CEO's, film stars and other notable socialites frequenting this club to maybe play some golf, catch up with friends, shop, have a meeting, play a game of bridge, get a haircut or spa treatment or simply to lounge around and do nothing in a safe, exclusive environment. The food and drink here is wholesome, exquisitely prepared and so very cheap and affordable. The club has a huge, well manicured golf course which is rare to find in the middle of this bustling city of Mumbai. It also has 3 bars and 3 restaurants serving up the best alcohol and food choices you could think of. Bridge is the game of choice for the elderly here among other card and board games and there a large area assigned for this purpose. There is also ample parking and a valet service. One cannot however walk into the club and avail of any service if not a member. I f you are a non-member then you may enter the club Only accompanied by a member who will have to sign you in. Any items bought in the club premises will have to paid for by the member using the member's card. A guest cannot order or pay for anything using cash or credit card.

There are three categories in sale offering the same product, different quality as well: a) air conditioned shops b) Road side shacks c) On the blanket on the footpath hawker or street peddlers (cheap imitations) .The road became famous to such an extent that all the fast food eateries like KFC, Dunkin, McDonalds, etc were vying for an eye on the famous stretch and then there were Malls built in and around to accommodate the growing ""Shoppers"".Let me list out some of the few stuff the Road has to offer (anything from Rs. 10 to Rs. 20000 for all ranges):1) Footwear 2) Cosmetics3) Artificial Jewellery & Accessories4) Handbags5) Lingerie & Socks6) Fast Food (recommended Jai Jawan Kababs, opens after 7pm)7) Western wear (Ladies & Gents)8) Ethnic wear (ladies)9) Sun glasses & hats10) Upholstery & dress materialsThe thrill of shopping on Linking Road can get you busy for hours together and maybe its a good idea to wear a Fitness tracker to gather the amount of calories lost in this delightful exercise of shopping.

After meandering through the fountain area the helpful cabbie drops you at the Rajabhai Towers. The sentries at the gate throw disdainful look at you notwithstanding the innocence of the youngster.

You find a bench at the oval though facing away from the tower. Vow, there is half hour chime.Your child is enthralled of the different tune of the cine. After a while three quarter chime takes all of you upwards. Some more wait & twelve hour Big Bennish dongs lift the whole family heavenwards.

Everything from damascened bowls to carved ivory is on display here, all of it showing the superb craftsmanship of which local artisans were capable. Fans of ceramics and traditional jewellery will enjoy this. But the highlight remains the building itself, donated by David Sassoon, the opium merchant. Also, don't miss the stone elephant from Elephanta Island which is located in an inconspicuous spot next to the museum.",0.9505,5

Apart from that, welcome.In this badly maintained place, time must have stopped sometime in the XIXth century. The entrance gate itself is worth getting into the list of artefacts.There are some clumsy tries to convince the visitors that India has a mastery of design, inspired from its former master the UK. We did not buy into this story, not more than we believe the English school of design be a marvel of the modern world.A lot in this place plays tribute to the former occupant, long gone. Some artefacts show Indian society and its distinctions. A place shows the different casts of India, with the untouchables... untouched. Unmentioned. Ignored.This was one more sign that the place needs a strategic overhaul, let alone a revamp. We are in 2018, not 1946.There is also a garden around the building, as badly kept as the rest.We visited as well a temporary exhibition 'beyond transnationalism'. The role of this exhibition is explained, at the entrance, by the curator, in hermetic language. It shows (our simplified version) paintings and other works from US-based Indian diaspora. The artists, we are told, 'travel through multiple narratives'. (---) the exhibition asks questions about new ways to articulate this new beyond'.

Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,preetibh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Friends,Interesting piece of Mumbai History,"This museum definitely qualifies as one of the hidden gems of Mumbai, because quite a few Mumbaikars themselves dont know about the place. This place got renovated between 2000-2009 and in my opinion deserves to be visited if you want to know about Mumbai's history. Did you know that this place is the third oldest museum in India? Right after Kolkata and Chennai Museum or that its history is linked indirectly to America's civil war.. because the donors of the museum were large cotton traders who got monopoly on the cotton trade because during the civil war the supply from America to Europe completely stopped. There are also old Mumbai maps displayed on the first floor of the museum.These are gems of history which i got while attending the free museum tour which happens every saturday and sunday. The Museum has also got very active in terms of organising events/ activities for kids and youngsters. So try and check out the museum calendar on its website/ facebook events before coming here.(which are very nominally charged) For instance I got my son here during the museum's treasure hunt  activity which he really enjoyed.  You will need 1-2 hours to browse through the museum. I would recommend joining the  guided tour because that gives you perspective on the artefacts kept there.Museum has also a nice cafe and curio shopt at the back of the museum, also check out the iron made intricately carved fountain at the Museum's backyard.  Don't forget to check out the stones kept outside the museum which marked the end of the Mumbai geography at one point of time.",0.932,5
Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,TripMahajan,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2017 • Couples,A little gem in the heart of Mumbai,"We visited this lovely museum on Sunday at 10.45 AM. Tucked away in the middle of the Jijamata zoo gardens, it is an amazing place. The beautiful Victorian building with its superbly restored exterior and interiors are a credit to the painstaking research and hard work of its curatorial team. The colourful Minton tiles and the  exquisite ceiling takes one back to the skillful craftsmanship of that era. The ground floor is divided into functional and scientific crafts and the artistic, decorative display sections-  both unique and beautiful in their own way. The first floor is dedicated to the Mumbai city life museum and has clay figurines from diverse communities that made Mumbai their home over centuries. There are also models of Mumbai 's topographic maps and naval craftsmanship.We were fortunate to be shown around by Komal Chitnis from the senior curatorial team on the scheduled free tour (in English) starting at 11.30 AM on Saturdays and Sundays. Komal was an excellent and enthusiastic guide and so knowledgeable that she made our museum visit even more enjoyable. As we were the only two visitors on the tour, we were honoured to have a private guided tour. Thank you Komal.Nice open area behind museum for picnic. A cafe, shop and clean toilets available.Entry fees only Rs 10 for Indians (and Rs 5 for children). Excellent educational museum suitable for all ages.Highly recommended.  Do not miss.The main gates to the zoo gardens are closed for renovations hence the entrance is via Patanwala road. This needs better sign postings to help tourists to find the museum. Hopefully the main entrances should be open in the next few months.Very good website with all info. ",0.9962,5

Bhau_Daji_Lad_Museum,Harry D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Couples,A wonderful Victorian museum ,"The museum is located inside the grounds of a slightly tired and crumbling zoo. To get to it you need to walk through the zoo, entering from the main gate halfway along the North side of the complex (on E.S Patanwala Marg road). There is no entry from the West gate, despite it being closest to the museum on Google maps. Whilst there is a fee to enter the zoo, you don't have to pay this if you’re just going for the museum, so just tell the guard and they'll let you through. Turn right at the first chance and keep walking, it'll appear eventually. It's 100R entry for foreigners, and well worth it if you like fine craftsmanship and a dose of nostalgia. The museum is something of time capsule from the Victorian era, with artifacts dotted around in wood and glass cases. It exhibits a superb range of handmade art, carvings and decorative products sourced from all over India in the late 1800’s. The building is in good condition having been recently restored.

Incidents of drug abuse along the lake and it's adjoining garden is on the rise. This lake is infested with crocodiles and there have been frequent incidents of crocodile attacks here. A few months back, a boat was attacked by the ferocious reptile and a man is said to have lost his life. Intriguingly, there is no warning posted about the crocodiles along the lake, not one I have ever seen, despite the threat of crocodiles. Lake is not maintained well, so a good part is covered under algae and other vegetation to the detriment of its look. There's also litter strewn around its periphery, which makes it so disgusting.

Chor_Bazaar,AucklandWiz,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2018 • Couples,Fun To Poke Around In With Good Local Photo Opportunities,"I had read about this bazaar prior to going to Mumbai with mixed reviewsWe hired a driver and car and this was just one of the stops that day. Parking is pretty difficult in this area so we made sure we had the drivers number so we could contact him if we lost him in the traffic. This proved to be a good idea as we did indeed have to call as there is more than one way in and out.Firstly the buildings in this area are pretty ramshackle. They look like a bomb has gone off. Apparently they have started to pull down some of the ancient buildings and we were told by a stall holder that they are going to pull down all the buildings to make way for new development.The day we were there is was very hot and the stores are in the open.The whole bazaar is really interesting. Lots of stalls selling all sorts. Lots of junk like a fan shop with old rusty fans and bits of fans in it, or the clock shop that has clocks that have been sitting exposed for some time and have corroded. Not great for tourists but interesting and I found myself asking myself ‘who would buy this stuff’ and ‘how would they make any money selling this stuff’ ?There are alleys of particular goods like the alley with all old car parts in it or one with old tools in it. There are also lots of stores with Indian statues, art, pictures, paintings, and decoration pieces. Now most of these proprietors will tell you that all these pieces are old. Some you can clearly see are old, pictures in old dusty frames and things that were clearly left over from the British days. But I would say most are reproductions.You are better to believe that most of the pieces are actually new and know they are good at making things look old. The thing is that while they are telling you how old things are, you are disbelieving in your own head which makes for a confusing shopping experience.I was looking at a piece in a store that I was told was old and that they had a bigger warehouse within the bazaar and to have a look. We didn’t think we could lose anything by looking and so walked to the warehouse. This place had 100s of pieces and we were told how old everything was and where they were from like off old temples etc. we knew they couldn’t be that old etc.- the law wouldn’t allow it. We decided to ignore the hype of age of the pieces etc. and decided if we saw something we wanted, we would decide what we thought a fair price if it was new without all this inflated history.In this warehouse I found a head that I fell in love with and offered a price I thought was fair. Once payment was made I had to hope that it would find itself to our country as I had him send it to me as it was too big and heavy.It has arrived as promised.We did take some photos of some items and later showed these to a very old reputable antique dealer in another part of the country and he verified our hunches- these things were not ancient artifacts as we were told. In actual fact this dealer had the same exact article and the prices were similar but the age was not.. they were not  as old as the man from Chor claimed- as I knew and thought.We were told that lots of hotels and drivers will say not too go to Chor as its too dangerous.We didn’t feel one ounce of danger. Yes it was dusty and we were sold to but as long as you are sensible as you should be any place you travel to or visit, this is a good place to wander, take in the sights, pet the goats, take photographs and watch the life of the market unfold. We didn’t get to see everything so not sure if the rest of the market holds anything else. It is a place to go for different souvenir type items but beware of the not so true sales spins, bargain hard and look around and compare goods and prices before purchasing anything.Just another worthwhile interesting experience.",0.9938,5

At the grand main entrance, you will find a liveried doorman with turban and belted long coat.I learned that this modern place was developed from the Phoenix Mills which were originally started in 1905 to manufacture cotton textiles.

And they have left a large chimney stack standing as a tribute to a very different past.  Indeed, this mall is located in the industrial zone of Lower Parel, south Mumbai where the sound of factory machinery has long been silenced.

Ferry_to_Alibaug,JKD,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2020 • Family,Best Dec 31st day trip ,"It was a lovely decision to take a day trip to Alibaug on Dec 31st. We drove to the Gateway of India, and parked at the MCGM Pay &Park behind the Taj. We walked to book tickets on the PNP ferry that left Colaba at 10.15 but would have been late to catch it so booked the10.45 Maldar one. Anthony at the PNP desk was extremely helpful in suggesting what we should book. He also suggested we book return tickets for 5.45 that would allow us to prepone our journey on the 3.15 ferry from Mandwa jetty. We had a lovely ride on the upper deck of the Maldar catamaran thats a 400+ seater. The ride took approximately an hour. Unfortunately the wada pav on deck was cold and we were quite disappointed. The coffee was okay though after we asked for them to make it stronger. The boat staff pointed out dolphins to us so we caught a glimpse of the lovely, lucky mammal! The seagulls flying along side the ferry made for an ABSOLUTELY beautiful experience!The ride back was even more comfortable especially, since we were full after lunch. We napped in the cool AC seats and reached the Gateway in about an hour. All on all, a smooth, very enjoyable day trip from Gateways to Alibaug! ",0.9925,5

They charge you Rs. 190 for one side. It was perfect to take an air-conditioned ride after 2 tiring days in Alibaug. Whichever ferry you take, it is much better than travelling by road.

Ferry_to_Alibaug,molak49,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Family,Time saving but crowded,Ferry to Alibaug have started after the monsoon season which was prolonged this time. The ferry is run by two three operators. Apollo runs basic ferry used by locals and daily travellers. Pnp runs a more decent and Full ac ferry. Tickets can be bought at counter outside gateway of India security check and directly while boarding ferry. Lot of ferries and frequency is good but at peak times and on weekends and public holidays it can be nightmare as the area is not shaded so you have to stand in sun which can be a tough time for kids and no proper queue system for different operators and no proper landing and berthing quays also. For aged people and young children it can be dangerous. It's run totally by private operators and no police or coastguard involved which may seem a bit scary. There are ample of life jackets and staff on each ferry is well trained. The mandwa Jetty experience is better as it's covered and has free golf cart service for the long walk to the terminal. There is a second option of speed boat travel which takes only 20 minutes ( half of ferry time ) but it's totally unorganised and no tickets issued. It's rates also change and can be expended in peak season (7-9k for whole boat which can be shared) though return fare from mandwa to Mumbai can be a deal breaker as the speedboat goes empty. But these boats don't have enough life jackets and they tend to be greedy to overload which can be risky. ,-0.9186,1

The frequency of these Ferry is pretty good. You will get one after every 30 minutes or so (Indian Time standards :P ) The last ferry that leaves from Gateway is somewhere around 5:30, so to avoid any last moment cancellation its better to take a ferry latest by 4 pm. It takes around 45 minutes to reach the other side of the shore. From there one can take a cab or a over-crowded bus to reach Alibaug.

The visit by the King George V and Queen Mary of England to the Cathedral on 3 November 1911 was an important event in its history, but surely the visit by a living Saint is just as important. Mary Teresa Bojaxhiu of India (Saint Teresa of Calcutta) also visited for a service on 8 January 1993 and there is a brass plate where she sat. The pews inside the Cathedral are a really beautiful place of tranquility on weekdays, away from the hustle and bustle of the city.

Walk around the walls and observe that so many Britishers died so young of war and of disease in India.Those before 1857 died in service of the company and later they died in service of the crown.In many of them, try this little test on yourself... See the sculpture and try and guess the professions of the people who are immortalized here. Doctors, governors, justice, generals and seamen.It's a tiny glimpse of the British Raj, their wars, conquests, victories and deaths; all in one lovely church. And yes... The stained glass is also extremely lovely.",-0.0141,3

When I was a kid some decades ago, it would be a treat to be brought here to see the giant shoe.  In those days there were hardly any gardens to speak of in Bombay (as it was known then).  I went there this morning for a short while as I had time to pass in the area.  The shoe has been renovated and repainted, but still looks quaint.Tourist buses always stop here for visitors to see this garden and the Hanging Gardens opposite.  From the KN garden, you can get a nice view of the Queens Necklace   of Marine Drive, passing the Girgaum Chowpatty beach, going all the way to Colaba.  There is also a higher viewing platform just next to the KN garden.The pathways are nicely laid out with a couple of pergolas and benches, several lawn areas and lots of trees and shrubs.  I was delighted to see the fairly rare Aristolochia grandiflora vine in full bloom.    This is the Dutchman's Pipe or Bathak Phool in common parlance.

This one scores over the Hanging gardens because the view of the city is more expansive and wider especially beautiful is the chowpatty bay area and the view of south mumbai. In olden days before the skyscrapers dotted the skyline one could even see the tops of the cranes in the docks on the eastern coast. A early morning visit to view the sunrise is a must. This park is better than hanging gardens as it doesn't have  too many walkways for joggers or regular walkers. The main attraction for children (and for me too when i visitied as a child) has been the ""Old maids shoe"" or the ""Old Ladys shoe"" a concrete model of a shoe which children could enter inside.",0.9348,5

It is really a beautiful place to be and just enjoy company of friends.We went with couple friends and their dogs and met plenty of people with their kids etc. Everyone was just enjoying playing or chatting or walking. There are few smaller parks within to walk and so lots of options.The only annoying thing was that the horses have their polo games at the field hence we had to wait till that was over in order to step on the grass and enjoy. Sometimes games ran late and because we drove from Khar it started to become late for us since our daughter sleeps early...But it was worth it nonetheless. Just being able to be out in such a big space made all the difference to our physical, emotional and mental health during the pandemic.I don't think there are any bathrooms which is another point of concern actually but the restaurant is just a 10min walk from the race course so could be an option.Absolutely recommend to any adult or child.",0.9466,5

You get to see all the hoopla that goes with the Derby without the Derby day crowd.  I did not know that you need a tie to get into the Members enclosure.  But they sold ties there (because of the Derby week, I think) for Rs 100 and I got one.  The entry fee to Members enclosure was Rs 160 per person, but it is worth it if you want to spend a special day and willing to splurge a little.   The members enclosure is very nice and it was not crowded on that day.  Plenty of seats, especially in the special temporary stand they had set up for Derby day.  Horse racing was very nice to see, even though I did not win much money.  You can bet as little as 10 rupees at the tote or play the bookies with the big boys (minimum Rs 100 bet with Rs 30 tax on bet).   Plenty of good food, beer and mixed drinks.  Nice way to have a relaxing day.  You can not take your cell (mobile) phone inside.  But there is a place for you to check it in and pick it up later.

But being a fan of science museums in general, I wanted to see what do we have in my own city.What I found wasn't something that just doesn't measure up, it was shocking and horribly inadequate. Most of the equipment on displays dont work (not joking on ""most""). Most displays are also very tired and dated. Also, a highly annoying feature is no air conditioning almost everywhere - in a few places where you might want to stay, the heat drives you away. Many of the models of dinosaurs, or the planetarium etc seemed like a laughably cheap concoction of some hollywood movie. An embarrassment for Indians to have such a science museum in their financial capital. Every other place I saw maintains its museums to a very high standard and those are the things that not only gets tourists, but also sparks scientific curiosity - and this one fails miserably here.Neither you, nor the govt should not waste its time here, and sell this prime real estate to raise money which can finance a reduction of 0.5% income tax for all Indians for a year.",-0.9791,1

The Shakti Peetha to which this temple belongs is the one where Goddess Sati's ankle fell during the fierce tandava by Lord Shiva.This temple has an elaborate story behind it, which states that it was built somewhere in the 19th century. Goddess appeared in the dream of P.P. Dadasaheb Hate and commanded him to take idol out of the ground and construct a temple. Following the dream, Dadasaheb excavated the exact site and found a statue of Goddess Laxmi that was covered in mud and sindur. A temple was built at the spot, which gained immense recognition over the years. Param Pujya Guruvarya Dadasaheb Hate Om Shree Maha Laxmi Mata Mandir Trust manages Mahalaxmi Temple activities.Several rites and rituals take place at Hedavde Mahalaxmi Temple on a daily basis. It is flocked by a large number of devotees during various festivals including Guru Purnima, Ghat Stapana, Hom Havan, Dasra, Tripurari Purnima and Shree Gurudat Jayanti.

Hanging_Gardens,Foxy-Froggy,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Couples,Very disappointing ...,"The reason this is called the ‘Hanging Gardens’ is not, as you may think, that it contains hanging vegetation, but by virtue of its height on the top of Malabar Hill.  The Hill stands 50 meters above sea level, so is not in any sense very high, but it does dominate the surrounding landscape, although the views are constrained by the many trees surrounding the park.The park sits within the most expensive real estate in Mumbai / India / the World, but is itself very lack-lustre and unkempt, and really not worth the diversion.  It was dusty, dirty, and a far cry from many of our hotel gardens we’ve been privileged to enjoy over recent days.  Having said that, it did seem fairly popular with locals and their children, which was nice to see.  I guess we don’t realise how privileged we are, coming from the UK, and this visit maybe helps contextualise things ...",0.9512,5

Bandra_Fort,Siddhesh Garg,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Couples,Portuguese Ruins Lost in Bombay's Chaos,"Who needs a Portuguese time travel machine when you can re-live her history in 2018! A watchtower ruin built in 1640, the architectural ruin gives a macroscopic view of Arabian Sea and Bay of Mahim. Historically a place that gave easy access to fresh water, Bandra Fort held strategic importance for cruising ships even after the Marathas took control from Portuguese in 17th century. There are not many forts to survive invasions of multiple kingdoms as much as Bandra Fort which witnessed the British Raj after the First Anglo-Maratha War.As much as the rich history takes you to some era, the present siutation is anything but a ruin. Demolished by the 1993 serial blasts, you can find the built garden dotted with love-birds everywhere. An amphitheatre is added to give more character to the urban wreck and you can catch plays, fashion shows occasionally. The tourist attraction, Bandra's pride at one point is now reduced to a love-making attraction. There is nothing to soak in except the humility which the mammoth Sea Link offers you- harmony against the urban chaos. Save for the occassional soft drink sellers, there is not much to absorb and much to exclaim- Oh Bombay!Best time to explore (not much to do honestly) is during sunset. The Bombay sun can be scorching so afternoons are not a good time to visit. I would suggest to give this tourist attraction a low priority unless you are a die-hard history buff or photo fanatic. - SID",0.7039,5

The Jamshed Bhabha Theatre (It's largest theatre with 1109 seats is ideal for orchestras, and is the only place in Bombay that has hosted operas and ballets. It's entrance is a beautiful ornate marble staircase. I've seen some of the best musicals (Disney's Aladdin, Mughal-e-Azam), operas (Pagliacci, Cavalerina Rusticana), concerts (Verdi's Requiem, Carmina Burana), plays (Merchant of Venice) and many others here.The Tata Theatre, with 1010 seats is laid out like an amphitheatre and has amazing acoustics and a foyer with a scenic view of the sea. It is often used for chamber concerts and talks. Dan Brown's talk after the launch of his book Inferno was held here.Experimental Theatre has a more intimate setting and 300 movable seats which allow it to be configured to suit a range of events. It's a great place for new age plays, like Motley's Father, which I saw here.Godrej Dance Theatre is a small theatre with a capacity of 200 for dance performances.Little Theatre has seating only 114. It is used to promote new talent, such as poets, dancers and musicians, and for film screenings. I've seen many Met Operas screenings here, and also the screening of Danny Boyle's Frankenstein starring Benedict Cumberbatch an Johnny Lee Miller.You'll often see some of the post residents of Bombay here, especially at events at the JBT. While there isn't a dress code, at operas and concerts, you'll see many people in suits and gowns and fine saris. Many of the popular plays get booked by members in advance, so for non-members bookings get over soon. Book in advance. All theatres have a cafe with good subsidised food. The venue is strict and won't allow food inside, and sometimes, once the performance starts, they won't allow you inside till the interval, so be on time. The NCPA Café has wonderful food (their khao sueys are really good!). They also host weddings and parties. There are toilets and ample parking, though for blockbusters, parking gets full.",0.9942,5

Though, we are staying very near to this beach, but not able to visit this place in last 4 years. We started around 3 PM and it took around 1 hr from my place (including traffic). The entry point of the beach is bit narrow, so creating some traffic. But the entry point is fully managed by traffic police. However, there are parallel roads to reach the beach. But those roads are full of up and down. So, it’s better to be careful in these roads during driving. The beach is super clean and less crowded and there is no restriction for driving. However, we have decided to park our car safely. We played football and other games and spent the entire evening. Though food stalls are limited to that beach, however, those are more than sufficient for evening snacks. If you are non-vegetarian, one could purchase Pompfret, prone, bombil and other fishes at a very cheaper price. Fishes are much much more fresh than normal market as sellers are collecting these fishes from fishing boats anchored there. One must go with family and friend for family entertainment.",0.9876,5

Then 15 minutes into the massage there were continuous loud unbearable sounds of drilling and construction in the building.  When I asked the therapist about it I was told that this noise happens everyday.  This place should warn their customers about this while booking and recommend timing when there is no noise.

Jogger_s_Park,Craig A,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 • Solo,Running track,"Joggers park is the largest park with a running track in the Bandra/Khar area. Generally well kept, although the running track does become rutted after monsoon and could do with more regular maintenance. The track measures between 360-370 metres according to my Garmin and is a good place for training. Personally I use the track a lot, especially for interval training work. The park is open from early in the morning before sunrise but the running track is not very well lit as the lighting around the track is poorly maintained so a headlamp is helpful. There are free to use working toilets which are ok for public toilets in Mumbai with running water for hand washing. There is also a water fountain for drinking water although whenever I’ve  drunk the water it tastes very highly chlorinated.  ",0.9565,5

Other visitors informed me that Aamir Khan n Tiget Shroff also lived close by. Pali Hill and Linking Road is a heaven for shoppers of clothes, cosmrtics n footware. There are good restaurants too.

The 1804 A.D. Greco- Roman styled building atop a flight of over two dozens steps and supported by large eight columns behind which glass windows and doors of the reading section provide a magnificent view from a distance. Visitors are curiously attracted to at least have a look, a photo or a selfie.!The heritage building in all white has a terrific hall in centre,with double height,patterned ceiling and Chandeliers impressively hanging. The newspapers and magazines section is specious. Reference books available,Students and researchers have study sections on two sides.The furniture is Victorian. In the midst of fort area, besides Custom house and a stone's throw away from Jahangir Art gallery, Museum,etc.,it provides a gala time to spend on Reads among the bustling tourist spots.You can get refreshments at noon in the adjioning custom house canteen. This section of the building used to serve as Town Hall in pre independence era.I couldn't get how and why it was closed down. If converted to Town Hall, it can provide an excellent royal  facility for performing arts on  the edifice of this heritage Magnum. It is also sad that most of the space in the building is occupied by odd government offices. There are superb life-size Statues of British officers of the times inside which are worth a look for its masterful real to life projection that brings awe to the minds of visitors but are surrounded by cupboards of steel that might have government files inside.Municipal corporation of Mumbai needs to wake up to restore the artistic and scholarly utility of this magnificent building.Nevertheless a must visit just to have glimpse of a bygone era where pursuit of knowledge was made in a royal way!Manoj Oza",0.9665,5

Town_Hall_Asiatic_Society_Library,gigikami,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2018 • Solo,Pitiful gender segregation. How dismal in this day and age!,"I went to the Asiatic Society to study, and with the idea that it might be nice to be a life member. The library is very pretty, and I love to visit them and study in a new place, especially when I have a giant paper due. Firstly, the library opens at 9:30am, but they don't tell you the Periodicals Room isn't finished being swept for an hour, so cool your jets in the foyer, and you must check your bag, so take out the laptop, all of your books and papers and lug them around, dangerously in peril of dropping to the parquetry floor. When you finally go in to the Periodicals Room balancing all your work you are told you need to be a member, yes, that was the plan. How do I do that? You need to fill out a membership form. May I have one? No, you need to talk to this lady. Where is the membership form please? 10 minues of confusion ensue. Not here. Well can I get one? We don't keep them here. They are kept on the other side of the library. Annoying but off I go. The membership form people do not arrive until 11am, and you need a passport (a current driver's license, with more information on it than a passport, is not good enough). She who treks around Mumbai with her passport in her bag is a sitting duck. That's what safes are for, aren't they? Also, we can't let you into the Periodicals Room, because you have to avail yourself of the references in the Periodicals Room with a daily student membership. You CAN NOT use your own psychology references, the internationally recognised, peer reviewed papers I have balanced in my arms and on my laptop (this seems ridiculous, and maybe a ruse to get me to leave). Perhaps I may use one of your references...(a ruse of my own to checkmate)...Can I become a life member? Yes, but...it takes a few weeks (checkmate). I'm leaving. Instead why don't you use the public library? Unhappy, but desperately needing to study, I go over and I could have used it from 9:30am - it's now 11:30. There is a large central area to sit in. Within seconds I am approached by a man and told to leave the area. Sorry, why? This section is for men! I say I'm sorry, this is just for men (I am utterly confused now)? Yes! Several men reading nothing but magazines scowl at me - get out! and point. Can a woman sit there? No. There? No. There? No. Only there - he points to a corner. That is the women's only section. It is a tiny corner of this giant glamorous library, hidden behind some junk-looking book cases so females have no view of the beautiful library which I am now starting to loathe, under fans blowing so hard you lose your hearing, and on ROUND plastic padded tables with broken lights in the center. It is designed to make your study impossible, and meanwhile there are a few miserable men sitting in the giant beautiful space reading magazines lounging on the lovely antique furniture. I loudly declare my horror at the pathetic space allocated to women, and tell the library that it is disgusting that so few men are doing nothing in the library but taking up the oxygen (to the delight of the two sweet ladies in the segregated section). A more sexist display I have never seen. I am all for cultural empathy, but this is 2018, not 1950. How on earth can the women of India progress if they are treated like this in a PUBLIC LIBRARY? Give it a miss if you are a woman. If you are a jerk, who likes to sit around reading magazines, basking in the glory of your flaccid nether-regions, and contemplating your naval, this is the place for you.",-0.9511,1

Town_Hall_Asiatic_Society_Library,Debarati D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2014 • Friends,Majestic,"Town Hall (called Tondal in the 19th century) is one of the most majestic structures among the  heritage buildings in the city of Mumbai. One can say that this building represents one of the last architectural remnants of the Victorian Bombay (Mumbai). The Town Hall houses the 'Asiatic society of Bombay' (Mumbai), which is a public state library in the city. The Asiatic Society of Bombay, a learned society in the field of Asian studies, traces its origin to the Literary Society of Bombay which first met in Mumbai on November 26, 1804, and was founded by Sir James Mackintosh. It was formed with the intention of ""promoting useful knowledge, particularly such as is now immediately connected with India"". After the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland was established in London in 1823, the Literary Society of Bombay became affiliated with it and was known as the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society (BBRAS) since 1830. The Bombay Geographical Society merged with it in 1873, followed by the Anthropological Society of Bombay in 1896. In 1954, it was separated from the Royal Asiatic Society and renamed the Asiatic Society of Bombay.It is said that the Asiatic got many of its valuable books from authors and researchers who spent countless hours sitting in its halls writing their books. The literary renaissance of Western India started at the Asiatic Library. The building itself was completed in 1833. The entire construction was made of stones brought from England and was beautifully designed in a neo-classical fashion. Within the building, the floors are covered in ancient wood, the staircases are spiral and the terraces are adorned with beautiful wrought iron. The vestibule, and the Durbar Hall of the Asiatic Society are dotted with statues, busts and portraits of the outstanding scholars, administrators and philanthropists who contributed to the society, through their research papers, through donating money and their collections of rare books, manuscripts and other antiquities.There is a flight of 30 steps leading to a portico with eight doric columns which is the entrance of the Town Hall. This staircase is a popular venue for still photography and film/ad shoots. Elsewhere in the building photography is not allowed. The library has over a hundred thousand books out of lots of them are classified as rare and valuable. Apart from priceless articles, ancient manuscripts in Persian, Sanskrit and Prakrit, it also has a collection of rare coins. Permission is required to see these collectibles. Being a public library, it has a free reference library and reading room, open to everyone. In addition, it has over 200 newspapers from across the country for people to read. Some sections of the library are open only for members. I visited this place to attend a workshop organised during the Kala Ghoda festival.The vestibule entrance towards the left of the building, has a wrought iron divided regency staircase adorned with an amazing statue of the 19th century philanthropist Jagannath Sunkarseth. After making way through endless rows of books, one comes across the magnificent durbar hall towards the back of the building. It is used for hosting exhibitions,lectures and workshops. Oval in shape with fabric covered walls and a scheme of natural lighting, the durbar hall is topped by a dome. The roof is adorned with beautiful chandeliers and oil paintings of prominent personalities adorn the walls. This relic of our Colonial history faces a severe fund crunch. Certain areas have been rented out to Govt. offices like the Stamp Office. Some time ago, an 'adopt a book' scheme has been introduced to collect funds from the public. Active public support is required to preserve this beautiful legacy. There is lack of sufficient display information for visitors to this building. There is no reason why photography cannot be allowed in selected areas for a price instead of the current system where govt permission is reqd.",0.9961,5

Though you will just walk holding side supports provided at skating zone, chances are there to fall down on thick and solid ice floor. I experienced it and what disappointed me is no attention to help person who fell down or having injury but showing his own stunts that how awesome he can do skating!!! Second disgusting experience was when getting back to snow shoes after removal of skating shoes. Being last person to get out of skating zone, had only pair of snow shoes which was not of my size!!! Lady who was in charge of managing those shoes was forcing me to wear those shoes!!! How one can deal with knee injury and smaller size of shoes at same time, & height is time limit was running to make exit from such snow world. She kept telling me and forcing me to wear those snow shoes fast as it is compulsory and time is over. Finally I left those snow shoes there itself and walked out with socks only.Pros:Good for summertime to get chilled artificial climateCan have some good photographs cherishing moments with snow balls, walls and other wooden things.Cons:Improper and careless Management/ Supervisor/ Helper located inside Snow World(play zone)Small area (Not enough space for Snow Boarding) and limited things to do with high number of people.",0.6647,5

The images shown on the website and description given makes one feel the place is huge and has a lot of games etc. But unfortunately that isnt the case. The place is small, and there are 5-6 games of which some arent working. Also all of them arent for kids so if you going with kids be prepared coz they cant go sking or skating coz they small. The good part ofcourse is that they have a slide for the small kids, and its really cold so you do feel like you are in a snow world. I must also mention that the staff is extremely courteous and helpful. ",0.8784,5

Also don't forget to get an extra pair of socks as the one you are wearing might get wet. The place is not very big in terms of space and there are not many activities too inside, but as I said before, it is a good place to experience sub- zero temperatures and artificial snow especially in the Mumbai heat. The artificial snow fall starts after some time and is pretty ordinary(done via a nozzle). The staff is very polite and cooperative. They also take pictures and display them on screen while you exit. You have a choice to pay and take a copy for your memories. Overall nice place to visit with young children or people who have not seen snow.",0.9115,5
Snow_World_Mumbai,NVR,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2015 • Family,Snow In My Neighbourhood,"The place is located at the lower ground level in Phoenix Market City. Online booking provides you with a reservation (through sms) and not a confirmed booking. No online payment (or option) to confirm the booking available as such. In case of reservation, you need to reach one hour prior to your slot timings to make payments and confirm your booking. Opt for this option only on weekends or holidays. On weekdays, booking slots are readily available. Any which ways, reach the access point 15 minutes before, as you tend to lose valuable time collecting the protective gear and putting it on. Protective gear includes jackets with hoods, gloves and boots, it does not include socks. You either need to carry them or need to buy it from the counter (not sure but Rs.30 a pair). For males, if wearing your own socks do bring an alternate pair as they are bound to get wet. Please note that you can only pleasure your stay not more than 45 minutes and not 60 minutes as mentioned by them. As in the last 15 minutes, the staff will ask you, politely, to move towards the exit so you can return the protective gear, to get it ready for the next patrons. If you have entered late then your stay is even less than 45 minutes. You have a baggage counter at the entrance.As far as place is concerned, an amazing place to be in. We have been to places of extreme cold climate but this place is worth experiencing, at least once. If you go with not much of expectations, you will enjoy it. The temperatures are sub zero, as claimed to be, i.e., -10°C.  Enjoy the chilling temperatures and your photo op. There are sledges, slides, skiing equipment, etc., available but still nothing much of an activity to do. You need pull the sledge all by yourself (as no reindeer is available, lol). The snow fall, sort of, starts at 15 minutes after the slot timings. For Mumbaikars, it is an opportunity not to be missed. Read in some previous reviews where comparisons were made to the one in Hyderabad. I would rather say that when it is locally available why would someone go to Hyderabad just to experience 'Snow World', they would rather book a trip to Kashmir, Himachal or Uttarakhand to experience the real one. So, feel happy that there is a place like this in your city too. As far as the cost of Rs.500/- per person is concerned, which seems to be on a higher side, it's your call whether you find it worth it or not.There are definitely a few drawbacks of this place. The snow is not evenly or I would rather say it is scarcely placed. Should have been a bit deeper as you can see the kota flooring at few places which is annoying. The ice skating arena is bit on a smaller side. The slope is not at all ideal for skiing. Activities not up to the mark as compared to what they have mentioned on their website or advertisements. Time slots are too small to enjoy, need to increase them. Igloos on display can't be called the same, seems more of a den than igloo.Note:- Do watch out your footing. Walk slowly & carefully as at some places the snow is slippery, as it is to be. You might end up hurting yourself. I fell thrice and hurt my palm but still enjoyed the place. Please take care of your valuables, mobiles while returning your jackets as sometimes you unknowingly place your stuff in the jackets. When the temperatures become unbearable for you, you can take a break in a room near the exit and rejoin back.Do visit this place with kids or friends, at least once, you will have a blast of a time. No matter what people say, it is worth trying. For Mumbaikars, feel happy there is such a place (besides the one in Esselworld), in your city, where you can enjoy snow as and when you wish.",0.9977,5

But sadly if you are watching in the regular screens, then you do not get to buy food from this cafeteria and take it out to your regular seats. So you want momos? buy Gold screen tkts to buy one and eat at your seat. That's terrible. I gave feedback to the manager that they can either close the cafeteria and let it be accessable to gold screen viewers but you cannot distinguish and say you can buy but sit here and eat as not allowed to take it to your regular screens.

Fortunately, there are a few like minded folks who are trying their best to restrain this kind of illegal encroachment. As far the place is concerned, the best place to visit would be during morning hours and one has to pay a nominal fees entry. there is one road which goes along the colony which connects the central part of Mumbai to the western part. inside the colony, you can get a glimpse of parks, lakes and milk colonies with a good ambiance of peace, serene and clam atmosphere. in fact the air within the surrounding is much more cleaner and fresher when you compare to the heavily polluted and crowded city. Hopefully, the authorities including BMC would be able to maintain this clean part of the city for future. in case you happen to be in Mumbai and want to get out of the traffic/pollution then this would be the best place to pay a visit with your family and friends. in fact if you happen to go from central to western Mumbai this would be one of the routes that you will have to take ( you might have to pay toll amount).",0.9807,5

Madh_Island,Traveller20202014,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2015 • Solo,An Underrated Jewel!,"If you are blue or if you need time with yourself or simply if you love nature, this is the place to be to spend your entire day in the lap of scenic beauty and natural excellence! With seamless waters, sand and sky to wrap you from all around, Madh Island is  every peace-lover’s fantasy. The breeze from the sea and the touch of sand will allow you to unwind and relax right from the rise to the set.Being situated off Malad, Madh Island is one of the instant getaways from the city’s hustle and bustle. I happened to plan it @1 pm on a lovely Saturday afternoon of January as I was looking for a hideout alone with myself. I quickly checked on net and came to know that the place is well connected through road (taxi, rickshaw, bus) – buses from Borivalli and Malad ply to the southernmost tip of that patch which is called Madh Jetty. On the way there is Aksa Beach and Dana Pani Beach also which are also important attractions. However, I had heard of Madh since my childhood and went straight for the target.After my spontaneous planning and quick action thereafter, I reached the place at around 2:30pm. Though on the way, the place smells a lot like fish!!! But trust me once you walk/sit/breathe/relax along the waters, it is all gone, though in the backdrop (at a great distance) you can see all yummy fishes being sun-dried.The beach was occupied only with a handful of fishermen preparing for fishing I believe. There were random empty boats bobbing in the sea. A couple of fishermen at distance trying their hand at some last fishing for the day. I had carried a spread, my camera and some music. And I think that is the best decision I made. I captured the place through my eyes and lens. I stayed there till around 7 pm relaxing on my spread with only the sound of waters to surround you from all around and realized that I was the last person to vacate the beach with the help of moonlight and the strength of my natural eyesight. This was the most beautiful day I had in the realms of Mumbai.All in all, everything was so distant to each other that no object – living or dead will come in your way of enjoying real beauty. This place will let you ponder, rediscover and rejuvenate at practically no cost. So just go there and earn the best moments with yourself.",0.9971,5

Sassoon_Dock,doctor-indyeah,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2016 • Solo,FISH FISH AND FISH EVERYWHERE,"It is a ""ritual"" for fish lovers on Sundays to visit Sassoon Dock, early morning just by dawn break. I really mean when I say ritual, as there are lots of things to look into and adhere to before entering the dock to buy fish.- Wear Chappals / Sandals, WASHABLES. They will get wet and that too with Fish Ice Water which stinks like hell in a few hours.- Wear 3/4ths or Shorts. Avoid full trousers unless you are not planning to throw it away!-Keep a bucket of water in your car trunk. You need that to wash your feet before entering the car post purchase of fish.- Keep adequate change. Pay to the change. Because if they give change in return will result in a stink in your wallet- Be there early in the morning,preferably by 0530-0600. That's when boats are being unloaded. Freshest of the fish, cheapest of the price.- DO NOT buy from the first vendor you see. There are lot more inside and the more you go in, more fresh and cheap fishes are. Go until you see boats next you.-Bargain hard. Give 50% of what they quote. Still you will be paying him more than what he gets from middlemen. So, no guilty conscience.- Check the fish before you buy. Some may be crushed and is of no use.-Try going in group, buy a big fish. That will be cheap. The cutting women at entrance will divide the cut fish perfectly.-Park your car at a distance. The fish lorries are reckless.It's a full fledged unit by itself, a unique one giving daily bread to thousand families. The fishermen, the middlemen, Fisher women who sells in retail, tea vendors, breakfast vendors, polythene vendors, taxis, head load workers, packers and movers so on... Worth a visit to buy fish.

If you enjoy experiencing the guts of a city, you will love it. Just make sure you wear shoes that you don't mind getting dirty and you're in for a treat. Keep your wits about you as the ground can be slippery and the fisherfolk are are extremely busy doing their days work. Fascinating to see how they bring the fish onto shore, clean them, sell them etc etcWe were advised not to take photos but managed to sneak a few with permission.

For example, a Bougainville costs only ₹5. Natural manure is also available at ₹30 per kilo.That said, the administration probably wants to dissuade visitors with their weird rules. An extremely bureaucratically run place - the nature park and the nursery have separate entrances with separate set of staff and one cannot be accessed from the other. Timings are most restrictive and both places close at 3:30 pm sharp. The nursery entrance is bang opposite the exit of the Best bus depot.

We saw eggs of many butterflies and a variety of Caterpillers. We also saw a special type of caterpillar, which has self-protection mechanism involving throwing of a dirty chemical. We came to know that Butterflies taste buds lies on their feet. Also, we must avoid catching butterflies, as they will die after sometime, as we unknowingly hurt their blood vessels. We also saw many dragonflies. Apart from these wonderful butterflies, we saw a kingfisher and a group of egrets, and there were about 26 different types of snakes including cobra. There is also a member of grasshopper family, which can go for two-step jumping. We also saw mother-in-law plant, also called snake plant. We saw a dog, which was very friendly. The view of the nearby pond was mesmerizing.Interestingly, people planted trees and vegetables here, but all the fauna like birds and animals and insects came and stay here. It is no-plastic zone, without any noise pollution.

Maharashtra_Nature_Park,Sh00nya,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Friends,A forest in the middle of Mumbai City!,"Maharashtra Nature Park (MNP) is a not a hidden secret. It’s been there for 22 years now. Enough has been written about it. What’s sad is, not many people know about it.MNP, once called Mahim Nature Park, is a forest right in the center of Mumbai city, right opposite Dharavi slums and next to Mahim Creek. When you step inside the forest, you will never realize that this 37 acre (yes!!! – for those who only know in square feet – 1 acre = 43, 560 sq. ft.) forest used to be a garbage dump till 1977! Around 1980, representatives from World Wildlife Fund and the famous naturalist Dr. Salim Ali got together with a vision of creating a nature park, which could be home to different plants, trees, insects, and birds. Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) then ecologically restored and developed this land, as a botanical garden, by filling up the garbage dump with soil. The entire exercise was definitely more complex than what it sounds in this post.Finally on Earth Day, 22nd April 1994, MNP was declared open to people.I have read that MNP is home to 14 thousand trees, 300 varieties of plants, hundreds of varieties of migrant and local birds, insects and butterflies. Has to be true! There are trails for you to follow and cover the entire forest and should take you about 3 hours to finish with stopping in between for photographs and just soaking in nature.It’s interesting to know that experts from around the world are known to visit the MNP to study the flora that grows on this ground. In fact, it’s a great achievement for a forest to thrive on a land, which has been eroded over decades of being used as a dumping ground. This forest is so much more than a nature park or a botanical garden – it helps us understand the importance of conserving our environment.I think the state government needs to promote this place more. When more people start coming in, more word will spread. This will also push the government to focus more on the upkeep of the park. I feel that because of lack of enough attention and management, the forest will slowly lose its charm. Right now most people who come here are naturalists, bird watchers, and photographers. It has still not reached a level where regular people like you and me would go and spend some time in solitude in the midst of nature. This forest needs the attention and importance it so much deserves. Address: Maharashtra Nature Park, Next to Dharavi Bus Depot, Dharavi, Bandra Sion Link Road, Mumbai – 400017Land Mark: Opposite PMGP Colony.Parking: You can park on road adjacent to MNP. It’s quite safe there.What to Carry: Fresh drinking water.Outside Food Allowed: Yes, but please, please, don’t litter. Don’t feed potato wafers to the birds. Don’t throw those wrappers and plastic bottles into the creek. When to Visit: Try and avoid peak summer heat, so that you are physically prepared to spend more time in the forest rather than just finish the trail. Best time for birdwatchers to visit this park is between October and March. Timings: Open in weekdays between 9:30 am to 6 pm and the entry fees is Rs.10/- per head. If you are planning to visit on Sundays or national holidays, take prior permission.Getting there: It is walking distance from Sion (Central Railway Station). Dharavi Bus Depot is the nearest bus station. If you are coming by train, from the Western line, get down at Bandra (East) station, take the Eastern Skywalk and exit at Kala Nagar Junction. Take an auto rickshaw to MNP.Phone: 022-24077641 / 022-24079939Email: mnps@bom7.vsnl.net.in",0.9817,5

Entry is almost free. The park has the following broad areas:- Dense woods where a variety of snakes (including cobras) can be spotted- A fresh-water lake with snakes, turtles and birds- A butterfly garden with a good variety of flowers and butterfliesAs usual, you need to be early and lucky to spot the snakes. They would retreat into the dense vegetation or the lake as soon as they sense you! Spotting the turtles needs patience; you may need to hang out near the lake for long. Spotting the butterflies and birds is much simpler.Unfortunately...you cannot go too close to the Mithi river..the stench keeps you away...Recommended only for nature lovers.

Maharashtra_Nature_Park,G A,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Friends,Not a tourist attraction but hat's off to the forest created on an erstwhile dump,"This man made forest is opposite the Dharavi Bus Depot, very near the Sion suburban railway station.  Entry is from the main gate for the park.  The nursery gate is separate.  No parking is allowed within though you can park your car on the road outside.  Visitors must register at the entry gate then purchase a ticket (Rs10) from the counter in the building inside.  When you leave you need to show your registration slip to the security guard at the gate.  Somewhat convoluted but everyone is very pleasant. It is not really a tourist attraction except for those who want to see how a former dump has transformed into a decent patch of jungle in the middle of a bustling metropolis.   School kids are usually brought here on study trips.  Photographers and nature enthusiasts come regularly.   Local residents should make the effort to go at least once to appreciate the transformation ... but do watch where you tread ..... find out why below :(I used to visit the Mahim Nature Park  very frequently in its early years, and have literally seen the forest take shape and grow.  This   used to be a dump surrounded by slums on the filthy banks of the filthier  Mithi river where it meets the Mahim estuary.  The MMRDA took over and with a lot of dedicated effort, created and nurture what is now a full fledged forest with a freshwater lake on the site.   We went again a couple of days ago after a gap of a few years.   Now let's run through the good and the bad:The forest is undoubtedly thriving.   Wildflowers and the butterflies and other insects they attract are out in force.  I was so happy to see some  karvy bushes in bloom.  A path goes through the forest up to the nursery with another parallel path nearer the main road going back to the main gate.   These can be slippery in the rains so do wear proper walking footwear.  There used to be a path alongside the creek - there still is but I do not recommend this .... read why below.   Another shorter path goes around the man made lake.  Avoidable, again ... read why below.The   nursery section at the further end, is now well established and is an excellent source for plants that you will not easily find elsewhere, and at very reasonable prices.  If you want to go to the nursery alone, there is a separate gate and no need to pay the entrance fee or go via the main gate.The lake  was clogged with water hyacinth, however   I am sure they will remove these sooner or later.  99.99% of the birds you will see - and hear - are crows.  That is because of the garbage in the creek and in the surrounding areas. There are other birds undoubtedly but you could be excused for believing that this is crow land.  Depending on the wind direction, expect a stench from the creek.The path along the lake on the eastern side was heavily overgrown.  When we attempted to go through, we discovered why - to our horror.  The path is now used as an  open air latrine by the surrounding slum dwellers who sneak in to do their job, and is covered with excrement.   It was also full of wildflowers but there was a noxious stench due to the disgustingly obvious.  I almost threw up.  It never used to be like this previously, and I seriously doubt I will come here again except to the nursery section.They do have security guards but I guess they are not enough to tackle groups of slumdwellers.  The people at the nursery section also mentioned the slumdwellers stealing some of their stock.Nonetheless, the transformation of a once filthy dump into a thriving forest needs to be appreciated, along with the conscientious efforts of all the staff involved.  It is not an easy task at all, given the circumstances.As mentioned before, this is not really what a typical tourist with limited time would want on the itinerary.",-0.1915,3
Maharashtra_Nature_Park,intz3007,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2014 • Friends,"Not in a best shape, but a good place for nature photography","Maharashtra Nature Park (earlier known as Mahim Nature Park) is situated on the banks of Mithi river at Dharavi, opposite the Dharavi Bus depot. Travel from western and eastern suburbs of Mumbai is well-connected via road.The place is not in best of shape, but school trips are quite regular for educational purpose and frequent spot for couples. The entry fees are quite nominal and the timings are from morning till late-afternoons.The best time of the year is to go around October-November as its the butterfly season. As an amateur photographer, clicking a butterfly is difficult, but if you spend 1-2 hours just clicking butterflies, I am sure it would improve your skills of breathing, posture and timing the click. It was a good learning experience.The park does have other creature life - Monkeys, mongoose, reptiles, bats, squirrels, and birds. At the other end of the park, various birds are seen on the banks of Mithi river. If you have a good zoom, you can find good shots if you are lucky.Lastly, do carry a bottle of water to keep yourself rehydrated, full clothing attire to avoid unwanted insect bites, and snacks to keep you refreshed!

Perhaps it was only appropriate that MNP (as it is generally called) was to be born in the midst of such an area. For, the contrast it offers is too thought provoking to wither ignore or pass by. It is a symbol of hope. Opened for public on 22nd April 1994 this park is an excellent example of Green Gold. One cannot believe when they tell you that Way back in 70's this area was nothing but encroached slums and a dumping ground. Today it a green lung to Mumbai. More than 15,000 trees, 115+ species of Birds, 24 Spcs of Reptiles and over 80 species of Butterflies. What else does one need in a Nature Park which is spread over 37 acres.

From childhood I visited this place many time with my friends / family.  Temple is only 2 KM away from Ambarnath (East) Railway Station.The name ""AMBARNATH"" is because of this Ambreshwar temple only. Temple Famous for Richly carved and decorated out of a single black stone, the intricate carvings are inspired from Hemadpanti style of architecture. The ancient Ambreshwar Shiva Temple dedicated to Lord Shiva, the construction of which dates back to 1060 AD in the 10th century, located by the bank of Vadavan river surrounded by a fenced wall. There are two popular beliefs of the local peoples here. One belief suggests that the temple was constructed by the Pandava brothers of the epic Mahabharata for taking a night refuge during their period of vanvaas.  They could not complete the structure which is reflected even today in the missing roof directly above the main sanctum area (Gabhara) of the temple. There is another belief that this temple was constructed by Shilahara king, Chittaraja and later rebuilt by his son, Mummuni.After entering the temple, need to get down a few steps in the main room called Gabhara to have glimpse of the Lord Shiva. There is one Shivalinga at the centre of Gabhara.The best thing I like about this temple is its never crowded, and not commercialized yet. People get enough time for darshan and get blessings from Bholenath. Only at Maha Shivratri temple is overcrowded. There is Big Fair on Maha Shivratri. On this day more than 4-5 lakh people visit the temple to seek blessings from lord Shiva. Maha shivratri Fair continues for 3-4 days starting 2 days prior and extending to 1 day after shivratri as well. Temple is additionally crowded on all Mondays of Shravan, Month of Hindu Calendar. Definitely worth a visit and easily accessible by train from Mumbai. Visit this temple if you ever been to Ambarnath.Getting There and Distance: How to reach Ambarnath By road, its a one and half hour drive. Temple is located about 2 km from Ambarnath Railway Station (East). From Mumbai, It is better to go to Ambarnath (which is on the central line) by train and then take an auto-rickshaw (share rickshaws which go to Ulhasnagar @10 rupees).",0.9911,5

St_Michael_s_Church,ThelastJourneyman,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2016 • Solo,Rise of the Mangalyaan,"St. Michael's Church is a peaceful respite in a enveloping haze of near-constant activity. The oldest church in Mumbai, known for its miracles I believe it is a must visit (after you see some of the other Hindu and Krishna temples).  I visited when the Indian Rupee suddenly became in short supply, which added a little more adventure than usual.Festooned with a dazzling array of technological gadgetry including precision photometers, meticulous mass analyzers, thermal imaging devices, multi-spectral cameras and glitzy gas sensors, a shiny new spacecraft elegantly entered Martian orbit in late September 2014.  Intended as a tiny baby step in planning for future interplanetary travel, the first attempt for this rapidly developing democracy is a ship that would likely enthuse my demanding satellite specialist friend, Kevin Ginley, if indeed it is possible to excite him with anything not involving Fairport Convention (the auld English folk band).  By most standards, the astronomical mission execution was flawless and it cost less than a run-of-the-mill Adam Sandler B Movie, such as 50 First Dates.Launched by the Indian Space Research Organization the spacecraft is named Mangalyaan, from the Sanskrit combination of “Mars” and “craft.”  So proud is the hopeful Indian nation that, among other things, they commemorated this memorable celestial event by featuring the launch on the new 2,000 Rupee note.  Probably, much of the Indian population is not familiar with their country’s new spaceship, and likewise the 2,000 Rupee bill, which at $35, is twice the average daily wage: Comparable to a hypothetical $200 bill in the States.  However, since November 8th, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi suddenly banned the 100 and 500 Rupee denominations, many Indians and others have had to become very familiar with their purple-hued, two-large Mangalyaan.  So too have the tourists.Now, the very popular President Modi was merely following up on one of his tough election promises to carve out a huge black chunk out of India’s economy, which is estimated to be over 20% of GDP (Gross Domestic Product).  He did this by suddenly delegitimizing the very popular 500 and 1,000 Rupee bills, and on Wednesday November 9th, these were all but worthless: No longer legal tender—as useful as a Zimbabwean Two Billion Dollar note.  So that certainly made some inroads into the ill-gotten, under-the-counter, black marketeering crowd.  All the Samosa-stained black money stashed away in tatty suitcases inside and outside of the country no longer had value.  Brilliant said the pundits; he sure stopped the criminals in their stride. However, for the rest of us it was a real pain.  Firstly, any 500 and 1,000 bills in our possession were instantaneously worthless, and secondly, legal tender now consisted of scarce 100 Rupee bills and plentiful purple 2,000 Mangalyaans.  Certainly it was not Modi’s intention to make everyone go broke, so his plan allowed for folks to go to banks retroactively to deposit or exchange the newly illegalized currency, up to a certain, extremely modest daily stipend.  This, in theory, would allow authorities to give traceable credit back to legitimate hard working citizens, and disenfranchise the criminal with ill-gotten dough-filled portmanteaus.  Furthermore, folks were allowed to withdraw modest daily amounts of 100 Rupee paper, for which demand now vastly exceeded supply—much like Superbowl tickets.At this juncture I’d like to point out there are over one billion citizens in India, many of whom now had to go urgently to the banks and ATMs every single day to surrender, exchange or get their hard working hands on cash.  For those living in highly organized countries, like Denmark, India may seem disorganized at the best of times: But now there were Justin Bieber lines around hot and sweaty, dusty, dingy block for every ATM and Bank of Maharaja.  I think lines formed on an inkling that there might be an cash machine around the corner.For touristy types, like moi, it was a novel challenge worthy of a one-season over-hyped reality TV show featuring William Shatner and Henry Winkler.  I am somewhat tempted make a poor taste joke about begging in India, but I shall refrain and just say that I had to work really hard to get a few hundred Rups out of the hotel cashier’s tight little mitts.  Even then, as a cashed-up, pumped-up traveler I was walking around with a handful of hundreds and two-grand Mangalyaans.  That’s like walking around in the States with only quarters and Benjamin Franklins.  Try getting an ice cream or a taxi with that and NO ONE has change, so don’t even ask.  Perhaps, and only perhaps, if you spend 1900 you can break a Mangalyaan.  Also, NO ONE has change.  NO. ONE.Now having observed this firsthand, the Indian people were very gracious with an amazingly patient and understanding populous waiting in lines for hours each day for days and days and weeks to come.  I can’t image that discipline in the USA—I just read an article about some guy losing it big-time back in the States because his Latte took too long at Starbucks. So that was how I finished writing up this little adventure on my laptop on an airplane, ending with an ode to overpopulated humanity based on my experiences in Mumbai.  Unfortunately, when I next logged on the Internet the story in the Times was all about chaos and near riots in New Delhi.  Oh dear.",0.9363,5

We attended the Konkani at 10:30 am and then the English novena at 12. The order is usually, invocation, thanksgiving, petition, novena prayers, sermon and then the exposition and blessing with the Blessed Sacrament. It takes exactly 35 minutes.There's plenty of place to sit, inside, outside, the wings, the balconies. and you can feel the devotion. If you're new here, buy a novena book from the sister's stall and then take your seat. Avoid walking along the center aisle, many people do petitions here, by kneeling and going to the steps, (its a common practice among non catholics). So don't make it difficult for them by walking in the center.If you want to offer masses, there's a booth at the back for that. Now they've even started confessions all day on Wednesday from 630 am.

Banganga,Dipankar D,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2017 • Friends,Superb cultural Value!,"I, along with my friend, who is also an ardent amateur photographer visited Banganga Tank, which is often called the mini ""Banaras of Mumbai"". This fresh water tank, along with the neighboring Walkeshwar temple, was built in 1127 AD by Lakshman Prabhu, a Goud Saraswat Brahmin in the court of Silhara dynasty of Thane. The site holds immense mythological significance among the Hindus. It is believed that when Lord Rama was on his way to Lanka, he paused at this spot to pray to Lord Shiva to help him find his Wife Sita, who had been kidnapped by king Ravana. To do so, he created a Shiva Linga from sand, which came to be known as Valuka Ishwar (meaning an idol made of sand in Sanskrit), thus, lending the temple its name. When Rama, thirsty and tired, asked his brother Lakshman for a drink of water, he shot an arrow into the ground, which resulted in a spurt of freshwater. It was believed that this water came from a tributary of Ganga and the spot was hence named Banganga (Baan means an arrow in Hindi).Centuries since it was first built, Banganga and its vicinity – with its unique sights, sounds and aromas still takes us back to a simpler, quitter time and remains a great spot to escape the city’s usual cacophony. As you make your way down, one of the many narrow alleys branching out from the main road and leading to the tank, you are surrounded by a motley crew of temples and old houses bathed in vibrant hues of red, yellow, orange, pink and other colors. You will also see the local area kids bathing in the tank.",0.9693,5

Banganga,Debarati D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2015 • Friends,Heritage Choked with Urbanisation,"The  Walkeshwar temple complex with the Banganga tank in its focal point is a living example of heritage choked by rampant urbanization. Here the paradox of traditional life coexisting with unbridled modern encroachment is all too vivid. Near the edge of the Arabian Sea at the southern tip of Malabar Hill, Mumbai, several small, crumbling, stone-turreted temples and flower-garlanded shrines surround a rectangular pool of holy water in an area of looming modern-day skyscrapers and traditional tiled structures. The tank is believed to have existed from the time of Ramayana. Ritual bathers who come here believe the mossy waters of the tank have healing powers and originated from a natural spring. As the legend goes, Rama rested here while on a mission to rescue his beloved Sita from the demon king's abode in Lanka. Overcome with fatigue and thirst, Rama asked his brother Lakshmana to bring him some water. Lakshmana instantly shot an arrow into the ground, and water gushed forth creating a tributary of the Ganges, which flows over a thousand miles away, hence its name, Banganga, the Ganga created on a baan .  Its waters are considered just as sacred as those of the great river itself. The development of the tank and the main temple took place during the 12th century under the rule of the Silahara dynasty.The complex was rebuilt in the 18th century after a Portuguese invasion destroyed it. In the shadow of one of present-day Mumbai's most prosperous neighborhoods, Banganga continues to function as an out-of-time devotional hub, its tolling bells and mantra-chanting pujaris drawing devotees to worship the divine. It is not a part of the usual tourist circuit and it is truly difficult to believe such a place exists in the tony Malabar Hill area of Mumbai.Was fortunate to visit this place as a part of a heritage walk.Also note that December is the time for open-air concerts held at the Banganga Festival.",0.9766,5

This tank is surrounded on all four sides by numerous temples of which the Walkeshwar temple is the most famous besides giving the area its name. There are a few deepstambhas (stone pillars with niches for oil lamps) near the tank which are lit up during festivals with small oil lamps. There is a small Dhobi Ghat (open air laundry) nearby too which is unique as they use old discarded fibreglass bath tubs instead of the regular concrete or stone pits for washing the clothes. One of the most serene places in the middle of the concrete jungle that is slowly overtaking the small houses in the area with huge sky scraper high rise buildings. The Maharashtra State Governor's bungalow and estate is very close to this site. There are ducks and geese swimming around in the tank and on certain days there are religious ceremonies conducted on the banks of the tank for the departed souls.

Banganga,keith h,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Solo,Interesting & Photogenic.,"Most people will probably arrive here courtesy of a taxi ride or with a tour group so they will be getting unloaded at the right spot. I was  maybe foolish & walked from my hotel on Ballard Estate. It's quite a stretch but not a problem if you are reasonably fit.    Only thing I would say is that you should probably set out as early as possible in order to enjoy cooler conditions & also to maybe arrive before too many tour parties show up.   If you do walk , just walk straight along Marine Drive & swing left where Chowpatty Beach ends & continue along Walkeshwar road which climbs to Teen Batti & then levels off & slopes down. I must have missed the first opportunity to access the tank but seeing a blue sign on a wall to my right that announced Banganga Cross Path 2 I descended 2 flights of stone steps & arrived at the far end of the tank.     The history of the tank is on line & in guide books for all to access so I can say at present, although the tank may be fed by a freshwater Spring , the water contained in it is of a very rich dark green colour & has a certain amount of rubbish floating on it.    One man & a small boy were clearing some of this rubbish from around the edges.       The tank is rectangular in shape & shallow steps come down to it on all sides with various egresses from the surrounding streets & alleyways. The steps & tank support a fairly large & varied population of geese & ducks who seem to know a good thing when they see it as they are well fed by some locals.   Some shacks border on the upper steps with a few inhabitants & it appears some laundry work gets done in the tank.   One or two small groups of people were conducting little religious ceremonies on the steps & in one corner there was a small shrine under a peepal tree where 4 or 5 devotees were chanting.   There are some nice pillars painted white & red at points on the tank margins.        The whole vicinity is pretty much run down & contrasts with some obviously de luxe towers nearby.   Some sign of maybe better things to come was a small work party levering out some of the  terrace steps under the eye of a supervisor & new stones being delivered.  A few women & their children go in for begging & one approached me with her hand out saying "" money, money, money. Bakhsheesh "" which was refreshingly direct of her.

Banganga,RAMESH K,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015 • Solo,Myths & legends of Mumbai,"India is a land of myths & legends and if they are to be believed then Banganga in Malabar Hills can be considered as the most sacred spot of Mumbai. According to folklore, Ram & Lakshman had visited this place near the sea shore during their search for abducted Sita. Ram was exhausted after a long trek and felt thirsty. He asked Lakshman to fetch water and as the only water available nearby was the salty sea water, Lakshman shot an arrow (ban) into the ground and river Ganga sprang out and hence the name ‘Ban-ganga’. Even though sea is only 100 metres away from this place, the water of this tank is sweet. There are many temples, old & new, around the tank, the most famous and ancient being the Walkeshwar & Rameshwar temples of Shiva. The story behind Walkeshwar temple is that Ram wanted to worship Shiva on the sea shore but could not find a Shiva Linga so he made a linga out of sand (walu in Marathi or balu in Hindi) and worshipped it. Hence the name‘Walukeshwar’.As per the historical records, Banganga tank was constructed in the 12th century as a reservoir of drinking water. It was destroyed  during the Portuguese occupation of Mumbai but was reconstructed sometime in the early 18th century. It is believed that the tank gets water from an underground spring! There was a time when there were around 20 large water tanks (talab/ pokhar in Hindi) in Mumbai that used to meet the water needs of the residents. Over time as the population increased and alternate sources of water (the lakes) were found, these tanks got filled up and there is no trace of them today except for the Banganga Tank and the Bandra Tank.As one enters the peaceful environs of Banganga after climbing down the Malabar Hill, one feels transported to the ghats of Varanasi or Rishikesh. There are steps (ghats) all around the rectangular water body. Many ancient idols of gods & goddesses lie strewn all around, open to the sky,almost in a state of neglect. At the entrance are two pillars which were used for lighting the earthen lamps. Under an ancient tree, the place where Lord Ram was believed to have come, his foot prints made in marble are still venerated. The entire place, including, the temples all around are managed by trusts run by Maharashtrian Gaud Saraswat Brahamins. Looking at the upkeep of most of the Hindu religious locations, it can be said that the place is relatively clean and well kept. A festival of classic musical is held around the holy tank every year during January in which India's leading artists perform. On a Sunday afternoon under an incessant drizzle and with an umbrella in one hand and camera in another I spent a very satisfying hour savouring the beauty & sanctity of this place. I returned with the resolve to come back again to enjoy the music festival in these mystic sacred surroundings!! This place would definitely rank high in my list of must visit spots of Mumbai.

The tank is pretty large and looks impressive but the surroundings could do with better upkeep. It is not tourist friendly and lacks many amenities.

It can be reached through public transport though it may be a bit time consuming. One needs to reach the Marwe Jetty which is in Malad West. From there a short ferry ride (which is available every 30 minutes) will take you across the narrow creek. On the other side one can take an auto-rickshaw or a tanga (horse cart) to the beach. The beach is not crowded and is perfect for a leisurely walk or for the children to play freely while you soak the evening sun or just laze on the beach. At times you will get ample sea shells on the beach which may bring back childhood memories. If one plans to stay over, there are a few resorts there which are decent and very close to the beach or on the beach itself. One of the good resort is Manoribel, the food is also good. This can be a good short trip during the week or on weekend.",0.9705,5

From coins, we move on to paper money, Bills of Exchange, Cheques, Banking, etc. until we finally arrive to things that the RBI does (aside from the obvious).On the whole, the museum is extremely well-curated. Entry is FREE! Since there is no photography allowed on the premises, one can purchase a set of 6 information brochures for Rs. 25 (or about 40 cents)!",0.6723,5

There's a back check with security in the building next door, the security was a little lax and we took our valuables with us.  It's free to get in and while there are a couple of security folks in there, no one is going to follow you around and watch your every move.It contains a fantastically displayed history of money, currency and India's role in it.  Well written displays, well laid out, with both the ability to skim through or go into incredible detail.Sadly no photos are allowed, as this would make a great write up with pictures.There are examples of coinage, notes and checks from years and years ago, all placed where you can actually see them.

Juhu,David D,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 • Couples,Great experience,"Have never been to Mumbai, except the airport and that was just to catch our connecting flight home. We were in Goa from 28th October to 30th November, so we arranged a 3 night stop over in Mumbai staying in Emerald Hotel in Juhu. We chose this because of a recommendation and it was close to the airport.The hotel was comfortable and friendly and we enjoyed our stay, the staff were helpful and friendly.We were a bit nervous about everything but decided to  regard this as an adventure.  We had no problem getting a taxi from the airport to Juhu, just before the exit of the terminal there is a prepaid taxi booth, where you order and pay for your cab. Our fare to Juhu was RS240  (£2.40) this was in a cool cab, which are air conditioned. Our journey time took about 20 minutes.On approaching Juhu our initial impressions and thoughts were what have we let ourselves in for here. However, thankfully this was short lived, once we checked into our hotel, The Emerald,  it was  about 4.30 in the afternoon  so we went out exploring. The first port of call was the beach which was a hive of activity  (reviewed separately) with its famous street food stalls.We also discovered the Beach Side Patio Bar/Citizen Hotel - also reviewed. Within 5 minutes walk of the hotel there are 2 Pharmacys,  virtually across the road,  an off licence and money exchange. Get a better rate of exchange at the bureau rather than in the hotel.The next morning we picked up a taxi outside the hotel which took us to Mumbai, journey time can vary due to  traffic, it took us about 1 hour and 20 minutes, we used the Bandra Worli Sea Link, toll road, it saved a lot of time and is worth a visit. We had had the taxi all day for an agreed rate of RS1,600 including the toll, the taxi man was so good we gave him RS2,000  (£20). We had a full day in Mumbai sight seeing including a visit to Elephanta Island/Caves.That evening we had a sundowner at the Patio Beach Bar and had dinner in the Aroma Restaurant  (reviewed) just down the road from hotel.The next morning we took a tuk tuk from outside the hotel to Santa Cruz - RS50  (50p), had a wander around and then caught the train to Mumbai. This was a journey time of about 45 minutes and normal fare was RS10 or 1st class RS110  (£1.10). It was a real adventure. We caught the train back to Santa Cruz and another tuk tuk back to the hotel. Sundowner at the Patio Bar and dinner again at Aroma.The next morning we had to check out and head for the airport and then home. We picked up a taxi outside of the hotel, it was the same guy that took us to Mumbai the other day, the fare to the Airport was RS450, roughly.Despite our initial worries and fears we really enjoyed our stay in Juhu, there is more to do than our first impressions. It is very handy for the airport, not too far from Mumbai, about 35 Kilometres, and plenty of taxis and tuk tuk to get you where you want to go. We enjoyed so much we have already arranged to stay here again in March 2016, on our way home again from Goa. Can't give a better recommendation than that, looking forward to going back.",0.9898,5

This temple was constructed in 1927 and was inaugurated by His Holiness Sri Sri Anantacharya of Kanchi Mutt on 10th June, 1927. Some of the idols in this temple were brought from Udaya Rajendrapuram at Vaniyambadi of Vellore District, Tamilnadu. These idols belonged to Chola Period of 1080—1130 A.D. The temple has a very massive Raja Gopuram with various sculptures of gods and goddesses. The temple has two prakarams. On the walls of the corridor the slokas from Bhagavadgita are painted in colors. The twenty four forms of Lord Vishnu wielding weapons in different postures and positions are seen, a very rare feature of this temple. The 108 Vaishnavite Divya  Kshetras are also beautifully painted . The ten incarnations of Lord Vishnu are seen on the panels of the outer sanctum. In the Garbha Griha, the statue of Lord Venkateshwara looks like a replica of the Lord of Tirumala. There are shrines for Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy, Raja Gopala flanked by Rukmini and Satya Bhama and Lord Rama with Lakshmana and Sita. All poojas are done as per Vaishnavite customs and tradition. In the crowded area of Fanaswadi this temple gives a chance to experience a peaceful and pious feeling  for people. The temple timings are from 5.40 a.m to 11.30 a.m and from 4.00p.m. to 9.30 p.m  (Monday to Thursday) and from 5.00 a.m. to 12.00 p.m. and 4.00 p.m. to 9.30 p.m. on Friday and Saturday. One can catch Bus No.103 from Chatrapati Shivaji terminus and reach the temple within 15 minutes. The nearest railway station is Charni Road Railway Station.",0.9595,5

So think something new and different to redevelop the place into a lively shopping hub…Heera Panna used to be one of the good bargain place to shop for fake stuff decade back… like copies of many brands…Diesel, Levi,  or watches like guess and all… or perfumes…. But these days people travel a lot…. Everyone has someone or the other travelling abroad can easily get fake stuff at best price so why would you shop from here. That too at insane price!! you can see all pan spits around the wall very unhygienic!!!",0.8526,5

Heera_Panna_Shopping_Center,PrabhuSM,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2015 • Solo,Not so great ambiance,"Had visited the shopping center on recommendation from a friend. It majorly consists of small shops of leather goods, phones & electronic items. The goods on display were average & never go by the listed price for any of the merchandise. You need to bargain hard! Though, the notice claims that the center comes under ""No Smoking Zone"", the areas near the washrooms seems to be smokers paradise. Stinky toilets too.",0.6588,5

Heera_Panna_Shopping_Center,1234786,3.0 of 5 bubbles,,Ask directly for half the rate Offered by the Vendor.,I had gone there today to buy clothes. Following are my experiences1. I like two T -shirts in a shop. I was offered 1800rs for two. However after bargain I got the two for 800rs.2. In another shop I liked 4 t-shirts. I was offered each for 500rs.However after bargain I took three for 800rs.3. In another shop I liked 4 t shirts. I was offered 400/t-shirts.However after bargain I got 2 t-shirts for 500rs.So I got 7tshirts at 2100rs. They are good and I think would last not more than 12 months. That's not at all bad.Guys Beware. The shop keepers are cruel at pricing. Their marked price is on their mood. If you find them good mannered and sweet tongued you will be cursing yourself later.  The shop keepers are the most  I cunning traders I have met in Mumbai. They have ability to lie in your eyes. You should never get over exited. Don't get over whelmed by the exciting part of the products. Always calculate the actual price. You will  get stressed by bargaining!! Not a pleasing experience overall. ,0.9469,5
