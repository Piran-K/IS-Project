Bade_Ganeshji_Ka_Mandir,Vikas Singh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015 • Family,Visit for the Panchmukhi Hanuman idol made of ashtadhatu,"This temple has been established by freedom fighter Pandit Surya Narayan Vyas. Located near the Mahakaleashwar temple, there is large idol of Ganesha consecrated in the temple. However the real attraction here is the Panchmukhi (five faced) idol of Hanuman made of eight metals (ashtadhatu).During the war between Lord Rama and Ravana, Ravana asked Ahiravana king of Patal for help. According to Hindu cosmology, Patala is the seven lower regions of the universe which are located under the earth.  To protect Lord Ram and Lakshman Lord Hanuman formed a fortress with his tail. Mahiravana disguised himself as Vibeeshana and took Lord Ram and Lakshman to Patal. When Hanuman entered Patal to rescue Rama and Lakshman, he found that to kill Mahiravana he had to extinguish five lamps burning in five different directions at the same time. So he took the Panchmukhi form with Hanuman, Hayagriva, Narasimha, Garuda and Varaha faces and extinguished the lamps killing Mahiravana."
