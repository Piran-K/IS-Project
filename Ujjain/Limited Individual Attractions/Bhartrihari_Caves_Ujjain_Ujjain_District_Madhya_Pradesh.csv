Bhartrihari_Caves,Surya Katakam,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2021,One of the most Visited place of Ujjain,"Bhartrihari Caves are situated near GadKalika Matha temple, above the banks of Shipra River and is one of the major tourist attraction of Ujjain. These 11th century caves owe their name from Bhartrihari who is step brother of King Vikramaditya.  History of the Caves: Bhartrihari born as a King, but still renounced his affluent lifestyle and adopted the grab of an ascetic. It is said that reason beyond that was his disturbing relation with his wife. The heartbreak led him to give up all his dreams and become a spiritualist. When Bhartrihari decided to renounce the worldly life, he came here in search of a peace to continue his meditation. In due course of time these Caves  became his shelter where he spend considerable part of his life.  Bhartrihari was a great scholar and renowned poet, known for his delicate use of Sanskrit in his verses. Some of his great works like Nitishatak, Shringarshatak and Vairagyashatak are considered as gems of Indian literature. It is believed that all these were written in this caves only. The interior of the cave is extremely cool, peaceful and spiritual. Narrow route inside the cave number 1 leads to the place where Bhartrihari meditated. The stone curved statue of Bhartrihari in the sitting position is arranged there for visiting purpose. There is also a small temple in Cave number 2 that is a holy shrine of the Nath community. Throughout your journey to Bhartrihari Caves you will have a feeling of travelling to a different era."

One needs to get down a series of steps to reach this place. It is more like descending a hillock. So travellers who are old or have a weak knee should be prepared for this descent and a climb on return.2. Having reached the entrance, one gets to see some old carvings, small shrines and a fairly new temple constructed by the goraknath cult.3. The actual caves are below this level also. There are two sets of caves having separate entrance rooms. Old people might find it hard to get down and climb the steep stairs here.4. One of the caves have an AC unit running in the main chamber which is really helpful.Gorakshaknath people have a go-shala at this place and sell fodder for cows. If interested, people can feed cows here."

Bhartrihari_Caves,Gary M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 • Solo,A visit to the Bhartrihari caves of Ujjain,"I have been to this holy site on two occasions and had conversations with several Nath Yogis there, who were very generous in sharing stories about their life experiences.The Bhartrihari caves of Ujjain are situated on the eastern bank of Kshipra (Shipra) River, about 7 kilometres from Ujjain city. They are almost midway between the revered Maa Gadkalika Temple (600 metres) and Rinmukteshwar Mahadev Temple (400 metres). Named after the famous sage Bhartrihari, these caves are very popular with Hindu pilgrims and tourists alike. The Kshipra River passes close by, which adds to the natural beauty of the area.These caves are said to be where the philosopher-poet and former King Bhartrihari lived and meditated after renouncing his throne in favour of his younger brother, King Vikramaditya. Bhartrihari turned away from the material comforts of royal life and became an ascetic of the Nath Yogi sect on the advice of his Guru, Gorakshnath. It is believed that he did so because of a domestic intrigue involving his wife that caused him great despair and rendered him disgusted with the pleasures of this world.Gorakshnath was a renowned ascetic and founder of the Nath Yogi sect who instilled fearlessness in his devotees. He is revered all over Northern and Western India, and especially in Nepal where the famed and fearless Ghurkha soldiers honour him as their guiding light. Although Gorakshnath is traditionally regarded the foremost disciple of Matsyendranath – claimed by Nath Yogis to be the first human Guru in their teaching succession – Matsyendranath most probably preceded Gorakhnath by three centuries.Bhartrihari is remembered as a great scholar and renowned spiritual poet, known for his elegant Sanskrit prose, including Vairagyas’ataka, Nitis’ataka and Shringars’ataka. His special predilection was towards the Hindu Trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. According to the commentaries of prominent 19th century Indologist, Kashinath Trimbak Telang (1850–1893), Bhartrihari flourished towards the end of the 1st and the beginning of the 2nd centuries of the Christian era.There is a holy shrine in one of the caves for visitors belonging to the Nath community with effigies of Matsyendranath, Gorakshnath and Bhartrihari. Every year, thousands of tourists and pilgrims visit the place, some out of curiosity and others to pay homage to these three great Yogis. Nath Yogis also camp in tents in the surrounding area and can be seen sitting around their ritual fires.Some of the passages in the caves are very narrow and there is smell of incense and burnt wood inside. Visitors are not restricted from entering, but those who suffer from claustrophobia will not feel comfortable inside. There are also ascetics who still live in nearby caves and carry out their spiritual practices. There are also several refreshment houses and restaurants in the surrounding area. So, whether you are a pilgrim or just a curious tourist, it’s a great place to visit."

Bhartrihari_Caves,KishoreMK,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2016 • Family,Could be skipped..,"This is adjoining to another temple , so usually lists in the regular site seeing trips. During Simhasth kumbh mela, the caves were closed so nothing to see in there, but there is another temple in the same compound. Priests as usual arent interested much, even if u probe them with any questions., You wouldnt miss a thing by skipping this. "

I had to climb down quite a few levels deep into the caves. The caves have bats hanging down, not much air circulation and hot. If your a size too big, you may have to think twice before entering.I met the most interesting young lad who is a priest. He spoke so charmingly well in English and hindi. What was more pleasing was his radiant face, happy, accepting of life, taking the world one day at a time. It calmed me down. "
Bhartrihari_Caves,Shashi Ranjjan Kalvaar,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015 • Family,City Tour,The Caves r at the outskirts of Ujjain. A decent place but moreover it is a temple. It has been misunderstood as a cave because the idols are under ground n u need to move through sort of caves look alike. But a decent and peaceful place to visit. A bit suffocated for air as oxygen level comes down n is hot beneath the cave. At the outside of cave u can feed the cows with grass available with the local pundit. Our kids enjoyed a lot.

Bhartrihari_Caves,padmaja111,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Apr 2014 • Couples,Legend is more appealing than Caves !,"Raja Vikramaditya and Bhartrihari are well known through out the country. While Bhartrihari was doing penance ,in these caves , Indra wanted to disturb him , Lord Shiva protected him by keeping his hand over him. That hand is still seen on the upper portion of the cave !And BHARTRIHARI WENT ON TO BECOME A CELEBRATED POET AND HIS POEMS ARE STILL READ IN SANSKRIT AND OTHER INDIAN LANGUAGES .IT is an example to show that poet lives longer than the king, in people's memory.the caves can be reached after climbing more than  50 steps but the repairs and renovation work changed the ambience  ,so ,one feels it's lost its appeal and ancient charm."

Bhartrihari_Caves,SharmaPari,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2014 • Couples,Did not seem like natural caves,"The interiors were all man-made with concrete walls and steps and floor. I was expecting some natural stone caves but was utterly disappointed.TIP: since the entry and exit in the two caves is small and the interiors lack free flow of air, I would advise those with breathing issues to skip it."
Bhartrihari_Caves,RajShar10,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2014 • Couples,Don't visit if you have breathing issues,"These are caves where, supposedly, King Bhrtrihari, brother of King Vikramaditya, lived after renouncing the world. There are two caves and the entrances are quite narrow. However, I could not find anything cave-like inside them as everything was man-made with concrete walls and pillars. Nothing like natural stone caves that I had imagined."
