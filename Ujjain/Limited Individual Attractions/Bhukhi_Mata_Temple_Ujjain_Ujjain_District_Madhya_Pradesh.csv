Bhukhi_Mata_Temple,Vikas Singh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Solo,Assocaited with Vikramaditya,"According to a popular belief associated with this temple, the goddesses of Ujjain demanded that a youth be sacrificed to them daily. The citizens were in great agony but they were helpless. Finally, one mother approached king Vikramaditya and demanded that he save her son. The king told the mother that he would appeal to the goddesses and if they did not agree he would sacrifice himself that day. Before night set in, the king arranged a huge feast. The flavours of different delicious dishes scented the air so much so that the appetites of the goddesses were appeased. They came to enjoy the food while the king hid himself below the table. On top of this table he had placed the replica of a man made of sweets. As the goddesses enjoyed the hearty meal and were about to leave, one of them happened to glance at the replica. She ate the replica and wondered aloud as to who could have kept it there. At that moment, Vikramaditya showed himself. The goddess asked him to express a wish. Vikramaditya requested that she should never cross to this side of the river. Pleased by his courage, she agreed. The goddess was Bhukhi Mata and the king made a temple in her honour on the other side of the river. Since then, she never came to trouble the people of Ujjain and no more young men were sacrificed."
