We chose to walk, but there are autos and share autos that can take you back and forth from the center of town. A well kept temple and we visited it at around 8.30 PM in the evening and there was literally no crowd. It is based on  the famous Char Dham temples. The temple is constructed in a layered fashion where one can see deities of the four Dhams one by one in each level.  The main attraction at this temple is the thematic Vaishnavo devi temple constructed at the sides.  There is a fee of INR 5 to enter this thematic place and can get the feeling of climbing inside a mountain akin to Vaishnovo Devi.  Kids will definitely like the place and it is more existing that a temple in that sense for them,  Photography inside this place is not allowed.  A must visit place when in Ujjain."
