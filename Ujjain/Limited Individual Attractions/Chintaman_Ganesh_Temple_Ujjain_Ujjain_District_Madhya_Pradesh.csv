Chintaman_Ganesh_Temple,Anurag Bansal,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Mar 2016 • Solo,Nice serene Temple ,A huge campus but not well kept. Took me about 20 minutes to reach there by car from Mahakaleshwar temple in the morning at around 7.30am. 'Swayambhu' idol is a rock formation which is smeared with 'sindoor'. As you enter the small sanctum sanctorum you are engulfed by a tranquility  that is hard to explain. A must visit place in Ujjain with nice surroundings & picnic spots that were under construction in view of coming Singhasth 2016.
