Gadkalika_Temple,rush-tr,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Couples,"Kalidasa found it very attractive back then, but not anything special today","Surely Kalidasa saw the temple in its most simple form, and not today's florescent colours. The building itself is old but completely covered up with all the jazz that one sees in most religious places in India, and hence unattractive. It was said that Kalidasa achieved enlightenment here under a tree and used to spend lot of time in this temple.The temple is situated on outskirts (three to five km.away.), though not very far, perhaps four km from centre. Autos are easily available to reach there. but coming back may not be easy. It is better to hire auto that waits there. we reached right at the time of noon aarti. The drums and bells were blasting and a woman started getting into the rhythm of the music. It was an experience. If you have some time, it is fine to visit, but if you are tight on time, this temple can be easily missed. There are many temples in Ujjain, and most look similar. Unless you are religious and want to visit, it is fine.Though it is temple and is appropriate to wear modest clothes, but there is no dress code and any outfit is fine."

Gadkalika_Temple,EnakshiC,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Family,Jai ma Kali!,"Goddess Kali is someone I have prayed to from childhood, and is a favorite goddess. So the opportunity to visit her temple in Ujjain could not be passed on. The idol is just her face, which the priest and everyone else prays to. It is similar to Kolkata's kalighat temple, where the torso of the goddess is prayed to. We spent sometime here, as it was a little crowded on Saturday. It is a nice temple. There is not too much space to sit and medicate though. Nice visit. "

Gadkalika_Temple,cosmic_avi,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2016 • Solo,Normal temple. But my visit was worth it as I met a damru guy and got to play damru for the aarti,"Ujjain being city of shiva temples, it is very difficult to distinguish exceptional ones from normal ones. This for me, fell into the category of a normal temple. But had an amazing experience here. A guy named Mr Meena, goes around ujjain temples played by damrus during Aarti. He has 9 damrus floating around different temples. He happened to be at that temple while I was there and stroke a conversation. And it eventually turned out that I ended up playing Damru for the Arti. "
