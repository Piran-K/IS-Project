Gomti_Kund,Surya Katakam,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2022,Very ancient water found attached to lord Kirshna,"Gomti Kund is not separate attraction, it is part of Sandipani Ashram. I was checking with all localities to find out this attraction and finally I came to know that this is inside Ashram.This is not separate one but very old one around 3000 years old and has reference to the Puranas and Vedas. It is said that Lord Krishna bade the holy rivers from all over pilgrimage centers for his aged Guru to carryout his rituals easily. Since last 3000 years this Gomti Kund remain water source for ashram and till today it is the main water resource for Ashram. It is also believed that taking a dip in the sacred water of the tank can help to cure the problems of devotees who come here to pray. But now when I visited this place. it was barricaded from all the four sides and we cannot enter into the same."

Gomti_Kund,Dilip123,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2018 • Family,Holy water but lacks maintenance,It makes me feel bad to give an average rating to this holy pond the waters of which were used by the Lord Himself.The pond is situated inside sandipini ashram. So not sure why this was added as a separate attraction. Travelers need not consider this as an extra place to visit since its included as part of your visit to sandipini ashram.The pond badly needs maintenance. It would be good to clean the pond and facilitate a holy bath. The current state doesn't allow to do so.
