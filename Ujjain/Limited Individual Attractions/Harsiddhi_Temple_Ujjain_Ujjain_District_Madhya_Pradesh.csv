Harsiddhi_Temple,Vipin Arora,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 • Friends,Beautiful goddess temple,"This is one of the shaktipeethas (or power centres) rendered rather energy filled place of Goddess . Legend has it that Goddess Sati ,the other half of Lord Siva , faced insult at her Father Daksha Prajapati's place because he intentionally didn't invite Lord Siva to a yagya or holy ritual . She took her life by immolating herself through her power. Siva was angry with this and sent his powerful soldier Virbhadra to destroy the place . All commotion broke lose . The people requested Vishnu to stop the carnage and he cut Sati's body into 52 parts which fell at different places and called Shakti peeths. Harsidhi Mata is one such pious place . Nice ambience with temples of Lord Siva and Ganesha in the vicinity "

Harsiddhi_Temple,The Golden Age f,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2018 • Friends,Shaktipeeth ,"It was raining profusely the time we went to the temple. We were very keen to see the lightning of huge lamp stands in front of the temple and Harsiddhi mata aarti. As it was raining lightning of lamps got cancelled we could only attend the aarti. The room of Harsiddhi mata is very small. During aarti time it is divided into two parts one side ladies and other side gents leaving place in between for the devotees to enter. Hardly 20 members can sit on one side. Few young boys in very loud voice recited the  shlokas of aarti it took nearly 45 mins, though I  was comfortable but for few elderly people the loud sound and standing for long was tiring. Don't know whether these rituals takes place every day or not but had a very nice darshan of Harsiddhi mata. I felt blessed after visiting. "
