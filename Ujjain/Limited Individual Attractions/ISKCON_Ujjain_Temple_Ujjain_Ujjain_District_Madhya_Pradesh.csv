ISKCON_Ujjain_Temple,AranyaVihari,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2011 • Friends,My ISKCON Ujjain visit,"It was peak summers of June'09 when I received a call from one of my friends Nityanand Ram prabhu (Hemant). He invited me to join a trip to Ujjain with ISKCON devotees and under his guidance a group of 30 devotees were headed towards this amazing spiritual journey.As soon as we reached in front of ISKCON Ujjain all of us could hear loud kirtan recording of Srila Prabhupada. The sound was coming from a loud speaker hung on top of a tree standing on main road just outside the temple. This was very auspicious and soothing to hear the transcendental sound vibration of famous prabhupada Kirtan which he sung in Nov-1966 at Tompskin Square Park, US.All of us were given the lodging details, room no. etc and 45 mins to get ready and go for breakfast prasad. The temple was looking bright white and shining in sunlight. The guesthouse is very big and a lot rooms inside with ample space and good quality construction as well.After gettiing ready all of us went to take darshan inside temple ahll, I was amazed and struck with wonderful quality of construction which was built within a year. All glories to Srila Prtabhupada's disciples who are taking his desires so strongly and seriously. Quality of prasadam (food) is out of the world and temple has Govinda's restaurant which serves a lot many dishes as per choice like Indian, Chinese, continental etc.........I must say that it was one of the best trips I had in my life so far....."
