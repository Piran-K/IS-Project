It is believed that Kal Bhairav temple is located here since 6000 years and also details are mentioned in the Skanda Puranam. Present visible temple is built by King Bhadrasen in 9th century and then renovated during Maratha rulers, and there are suppose to be some good paintings in the Malwa style inside  but they are not visible today. Secondly no one has attention towards them as all eyes are on the deity, into whose mouth liquor is poured. This temple is Known for:1. This Kal Bhairav is regarded as the guardian of Avanthikapuram, which is called as Ujjain today. Due to this reason Ujjain Kal Bhairav lord is also called as Kotwal of the city.2. Liquor is offered here to Devotee as Prasad through out the year, witch is strange but true. The Priest offers Liquor in saucer and takes the saucer near the mouth of the Kal Bhairav idol, When he starts tilting the saucer, with in Minutes the wine will get empty and no one knows where it is going. Devotees believes that lord is having this Liquor.3. As per the standard rule Devotees first has to visit this temple and then only visit Mahakal Mandir. It is believed that without visiting Kal Bhairav temple, Ujjain trip will not fulfill and also if you are not visiting Kal Bhairav before Mahakal Mandir Visit, your wishes will not fulfill and will not get blessings of Mahakal. So most of the visitors first Visit's Kal Bhairav and then visits Mahakal Temple.Temple Timings:Morning 06:00 to Evening 08:00"

Situated in the outskirts of the city area, this temple is famous for its unique offering of liquor as prasadam for the deity. Visitors to this temple offer liquor besides usual offerings like coconut and flowers etc to the deity. The priest takes a small quantity of liquor in a plate and takes it near the lips of the deity. Within few seconds the liquor goes inside the mouth of the deity. Throughout the day this system continues and nobody knows as to where this liquor has gone. Obviously, for the followers, it is a miracle of the Lord; and one cannot deny it too as the miracle happens just in front of our eyes, so there is no doubt about rethinking or doubting."
