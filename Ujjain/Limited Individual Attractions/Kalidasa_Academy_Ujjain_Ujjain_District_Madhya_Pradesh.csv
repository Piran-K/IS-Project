Kalidasa_Academy,Gary M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 • Family,"Kalidasa Akademi on University Road, Ujjain, is home to the Indian arts.","One of the more interesting places to visit in the Ujjain is the Kalidasa Academy on University Road, which was established by the Madhya Pradesh government in 1978 to honour the memory and works of Mahakavi Kalidasa, a great Indian poet and dramatist in the 4th Century B.C. Often described as the “Shakespeare of India”, a recent discovery of an inscription in 1964 is said to establish that he was born in Ujjain (then Ujjayini) around the time of the famous King Chandragupta Vikramaditya. Although, Sanskrit scholar Lakshmi Dhar Kalla (1891-1953) concluded that Kalidasa was born in Kashmir. But don’t try telling that to anyone from Ujjain. Mahakavi Kalidasa’s famous quotes include:“Please subdue the anguish of your soul. Nobody is destined only to happiness or to pain. The wheel of life takes one up and down by turn.”“Today well-lived makes every yesterday a dream of happiness.”According to one popular story, Kalidasa was an uneducated man who, through good fortune, married a princess. Challenged by his wife to better himself, he took up the study of poetry and went on to become one of India’s legendary poets. Another story relates that, in the latter part of his life, he visited the king of Sri Lanka and, because of some treachery there, was murdered. Their website informs us that Kalidasa Academy was established with the following objectives:1)	Study and exploration of Kalidasa’s literature from both a literary and an academic point of view, and also from the interdisciplinary angles in terms of its total impact on the various forms;2)	Translation, preparation, publication and documentation of Kalidasa’s and other Sanskrit works in various world languages, with particular accent on preparing stage versions of Sanskrit plays in Hindi and other Indian languages;3)	Establishment of a model Sanskrit theatre (Natyamandap) as per the norms of Bharata’s Natya Shastra, with a view to attempt authentic reconstruction of the ancient style and to facilitate regular production of Kalidasa’s and other Sanskrit plays by eminent classical theatre personalities from all over the country as well as abroad.4)	Collection and analysis of all available material relating to Sanskrit theatre and those forms which are living remnants of the classical style;5)	Establishment of a museum of Sanskrit theatrical arts and a library of traditional music, theatre and dance costumes etc. and their documentation through tapes, films and other media, including production of books of Sanskrit plays and the like;6)	Facilities for imparting training in classical theatre and for undertaking research in related areas. The Academy complex consists of an indoor theatre, a museum, a library, a mini-stage for rehearsals, lecture and seminary halls, research facilities for scholars, and a large open-air theatre.I have visited Kalidasa Academy on many occasions to attend plays, art exhibitions, vocal and music recitals, classical dance performances and conferring ceremonies. On many of these occasions my wife, Sarita McHarg, has been performing either as the main artist or in a supporting role. Enquiries at the office will inform you of upcoming events so you can ascertain which programs best suit your interests."

Kalidasa_Academy,Vikas Singh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2016 • Solo,Must for art and culture lovers,"Established in the year 1978, the academy is dedicated to the life and works of great poet Kalidas. The Academy got its own buildings in 1983 designed by architect Hema Sankalia. A new building NAVAMSHA was constructed in 1995. The academy organizes the annual Kalidas festival. Kalash yarta and Nandi festival are some of the significant programs of this festival. In 2010 a l lotus pond was developed behind the complex with a well shaded pathway .The pond is visited by a number of avian species. A number of sign posts have been erected around the bond with information on these birds. Beautiful paintings on the boundary wall of the pond depict scenes from Kalidas’s works such as Meghadutam, Raghuvansham and Ritusanharam. In 2016 on occasion of Simhastha a mini garden was developed and 66 plant species mentioned in Kalidas’s works were planted in the garden."

Kalidasa_Academy,sumit100051781,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2015,Disappointment all the way,"We went with big expectations, hoping that this institute would do justice to the importance of Poet Kalidasa in our literary history. Thoroughly disappointed, by the pedestrian kind of design, the lackadaisical maintenance, and even indifference towards the rare and stray visitors like us. We were told that we cannot visit the library ( which was our prime target ) because the person in charge has gone back home, and, in fact, we were told that we should have rung up and informed before coming. This venue had huge potential, but sadly unrealised."
