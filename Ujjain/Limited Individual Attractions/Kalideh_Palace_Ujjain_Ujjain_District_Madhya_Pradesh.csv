Kalideh_Palace,aliasgarkb,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Oct 2019 • Solo,Dilapidated and neglected,"This is a beautiful monsoon gateaway of Ujjain town. With spectacular water bodies and a rich history it is worth a visit. But due to vandalism by local visitors and administration's apathy this is in bad shape. Garbage is littered all around the river and palace premises. Locals use it for secret datings, drinking and gambling. The watchmen and on-duty policemen too join them. Only the Sun temple is open for visitors while other chambers and halls are inaccessible. The administration is unable to guard and preseve it so they find an easy solution of locking it."

Kalideh_Palace,RanjithKumarPrabhu,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2018 • Family,Palace maintained by ASI,"Located in the banks of Kshipra. This palace is in ruins and entry is denied inside due to its damaged condition. Seems ASI is reluctant in maintaining it. Built during the era of Muhammed Khilji, the boards show that Akbar and Jehangir also visited here. The palace was later in the hands of Scindia dynasty. There is also a surya mandir inside."

It is away form the main city of Ujjain, located in a serene place. It has a main structure with beautiful carvings, domes and gates, a nice architectural marvel.

Kalideh_Palace,Vikas Singh,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2015 • Family,A stunning piece of rich heritage,"The Kaliadeh Palace is located on the banks of the River Shipra .The Avanti-mahatmya of Skanda Purana has recorded a description of the Sun temple and two tanks here- Surya Kunda and Brahma Kunda. A fragmented inscription recovered from this place records building of the palace in 1458 AD, by Sultan of Malwa, Mahmud Khilji. The palace is built over a mound and gives a beautiful view of the surrounding area. The central dome of the palace is a beautiful example of Persian architecture. There are several underground chambers some of which once served as royal kitchen.  Colonel Stewart records in his book “History of Central India” that later Sultan Naseeruddin Khilji diverted the flow of Shipra River through 52 tanks so that water cooled down considerably. Addicted to mercury, the Sultan used to lie down intoxicated in the tanks. He is later believed to have drowned in one of these tanks while lying down intoxicated. Two Persian inscriptions found in one of the long corridors of the palace record the visits of Emperor Akbar and Jahangir to this palace According to Abul Fazal’s Akbarnama, Mughal emperor Akbar rested at this the palace on 25 Jan, 1599 during his Deccan military campaign. Later in 1616, Jahangir stayed with Sir Thomas Roe in this palace. During his stay here, Jahangir used to visit regularly saint Jadrup who had his hut in the jungles nearby. He used to travel by boat to listen to holy discourses.The palace was destroyed in the time of the Pindaris. In 1886 Sir Michale Filose partially restored the palace and used it as his residence. After his death the palace again fell into ruins. It was then restored by Madhav Rao Scindia in 1920. He added many buildings such as the court, guest house and other state offices. The Sun Temple was also restored by the family."
Kalideh_Palace,Sonia Sandhu,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2014 • Couples,Not sure if its worth a visit!,I visited this palace with a great expectation of a heritage site and it was a huge disappointment. The palace is not maintained at all. Its terrible to see such a negligence to the heritage property. All garbage around. Sadly i wont recommend anyone to visit this place.
Kalideh_Palace,mayaKasaragod,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Feb 2015 • Family,Requires lot of attention.,"This is the only place in MP tourist area appeared very dirty and neglected. This property belongs to Scindia family. There is a Raja mahal and Rani Mahal and near the bridge the water storage area is there. But Palace in ruins Where MP tourism started maintaining. The Water body requires cleaning, which will be  very dirty during winter and Summer when water level goes down. The Rani Mahal can be converted into either a beautiful resort or a school.Difficult locate easily, because very few will be knowing about this place.Should ask about Bhavan kund, to locate this."

Kalideh_Palace,electron2014,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2014 • Family,"Terrible place, Nothing is there","I went to Kalideh Palace and found very hard to search this place. There were no signboards marking this and I could find the signboard 500 mtrs just before the place. When I reached there in evening, I was surprise by its condition -- the walls are broken and ceiling is falling. Building is unstable and I would recommend not to go inside and be safe. Disklikes* No signboards* As marketed on Incredible India portal, you won't find it like that. Its waste of time. * Place is not safe, building might fall anytime. * Place is not maintained"
Kalideh_Palace,vinodkhedkar,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jul 2014 • Friends,Palace in bad shape !,"Situated on the banks of the Shipra, the island-like site immediately conjures up the natural beauty of ancient Ujjain which poets down the ages have waxed lyrical. The glorious landscape of the flowing river on both sides of the palace and the man-made tanks and channels, with water gurgling through them, provide a spectacular backdrop to the imposing building.The central dome of the palace is a beautiful example of Persian architecture. Two Persian inscriptions found in one of the long corridors of the palace record the visits of Emperor Akbar and Jehangir to this palace.The palace was broken down in the time of the Pindaris and was restored by Madhav Rao Scindia in 1920 to its present glory. The Sun Temple was also restored by the family.Present MP government should take initiative to restore the glory."
Kalideh_Palace,Rebekka N,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2014 • Friends,"Kalideh Palace ,Ujjain","Ujjain is a temple town. If you are not a pilgrim then dont go there , its messy and ugly except for one magical place : the Kalideh Palace on the Shipra river , just outside Ujjain. It's a large Muslim era haveli , out of red sandstone with minarets and jharokas , absolutely beautiful and spectacularly located directly on an island on the Shipra .It is approached by a arched causeway over the now polluted Shipra. The building is practically derelict , all the entrances are boarded up except for one which has been opened to create a Ram mandir. The guide book says that there is an inscription inside the building to  record the visits of Emperors Akbar and Jehangir. It's a tragedy that the state has allowed it to go to ruin,"
