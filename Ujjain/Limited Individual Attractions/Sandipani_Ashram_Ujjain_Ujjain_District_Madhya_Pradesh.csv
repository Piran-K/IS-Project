Sandipani_Ashram,ivanand77,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2018,Lord Krishna's School,"As per Indian Mythology, Lord Krishna came to Ujjain (then known as Ujjayini) in his childhood for his education and studied in this very Ashram. Rishi Sandipani was his Guru and this is the place where he met his friend Sudama. Here you will see a statue of standing Nandi (perhaps the only standing Nandi in the world). It is said that when Lord Krishna came to Ujjain for his studies, Lord Shiva as Mahakaal and king of Ujjayini visited him in Sandipani Ashram to pay his respects. Since two Lords were meeting, the Nandi could not sit and hence the idol of Nandi is in standing pose. This sure is a not to be missed place."
