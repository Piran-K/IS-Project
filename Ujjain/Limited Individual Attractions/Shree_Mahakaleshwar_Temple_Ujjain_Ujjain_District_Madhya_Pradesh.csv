Basma Aarathi in midnight is special.,"Midnight Pooja wiith Sacred Ash from Burial Grounds earlier and now, Ash made within the temple is the special occasion that takes one to a trance feel. Visiting in other hours is also special, especially when one can get near the Shivallinga and pour water, get to touch the lingam and pray right then and there. It was so thrilling and a the experience is not definable. One should experience it. It was a once in a life time opportunity."

Shree_Mahakaleshwar_Temple,Abhishek,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022,Do Read If one has zero Idea of going to Ujjain Mahakaleswar...,"1) In any Trip, one of the most important thing required is stay. I would recommend people to use clock rooms at railway station to deposit luggage. The railway station is near to temple. Even in worst traffic one can reach by max 30min. Hotels like Satyug may charge 6K and above but are good in facility. Hotels like Dayal guest house may charge 3K and above but room is very much compact. Once the stay is fixed then one needs food2) Food facility is very high. Even near Sandipni Ashram one can go to restaurant...The entire thali buffet may cost around 200rs per person.3) After coming to ujjain i would suggest one to go to Ramghat and take bath in river. Be cautious as the river flow rises drastically...Within hours of my stay the river arose by 2-3 steps4)  After the bath, i would suggest to visit temple. But i would say visit in night. At-least one may see bhasm aarti around 22:30. During my visit some big person came to temple and hence the crowd was pushed outside the temple. Collector, joint collector, SP all vehicles were parked...5) By 23:00hrs you will be coming out of temple so do visit, bada ganapti...6) Sleep in night and next day one can go to places all over ujjain like harsidhi, nag-chandreswar temple, mangalnath, chintamani ganesh, gad kaali, kaal bhariva (one of the cutest god I have seen in my life)....Do feel the ambience of gad kaali and kaal bhairava...7) In the overall trip the only discouraging factor may be the long intentional queues/barricades created by govt..... which may lead in blocking of route to temple ( like we could not go to harsidhi as routes were blocked)....But over come this thinking as the only king of the the entire time is watching everything...."

Shree_Mahakaleshwar_Temple,Swiggy Wala #swiggywala,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Shree mahakaleshwar jyotirlinga ,"Mahakaleshwar is the only jyotirlinga that faces south, and hence the name dakshinamukhi. This is because the direction of death is believed to be south. As Lord Shiva faces south, it symbolizes that he is master of death. People worship Mahakaleshwar to prevent untimely death. "
Shree_Mahakaleshwar_Temple,sandeepk3362015,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022,Jai Mahakal,"I visited with my family during June, 2022. I had a wonderful experience there. A few tips for pilgrims:Regarding JAL Abhishek:1. Rules of temple change on daily basis. We visited on Saturday around 6:30 pm but temple authorities told us that JAL ABHISHEK timings are from 6 am to 4 pm. Then we visited next day (i.e. Sunday) around 12 (noon). Then we were told that JAL ABHISHEK will be allowed till 1 pm only. So rules change on daily basis. Be prepared for the same.2. You need to pay Rs 1500 for 2 persons but for single person, you need to pay Rs 1000. Children above 10 years are treated as Adult and they need a Ticket for JAL ABHISHEK. Till 10 years, children need not buy any ticket.3. All males (including small children) need to wear Dhoti for entering Garb Grah. Similarly, all females (incl small kids) need to wear saree for entering Garb Grah.4. Water and lota will be provided to you free-of-cost inside Garb Grah. Some people will try to cheat you by charging money for that. Do not fall pray to them.5. Earlier Tickets were sold outside Bada Ganesh ji's temple. But now, tickets are being sold outside Bharat Mata temple.6. You cannot carry anything like prasad or flowers to Garb Grah. Security personals will snatch the same from you.7. It is better to buy old dhoti and chola set from shops outside the temple. Else you will have to wait for other devotees to share dhoti with you after their puja. One set of dhoti/chola will cost you Rs 250. Shopkeepers will help you in wearing dhoti if you require.8. Always visit mandir of Sakshi Gopal ji after visiting Shree Mahakal ji to register your attendance.9. Visit Kal Bhairav temple after visiting this temple.Regarding VIP tickets:1. Each VIP ticket costs Rs 250 per person. 2. Benefit of VIP ticket is that you reduce time in waiting in queues. Also, you get an  opportunity to see Shri Mahakal ji from first 2 rows instead of rows from 3rd number and onwards."

Would like to come back again."

There are many small temples within the temple compound . We did not go for basmarti . The laddu prasadam which is sold inside temple compound is tasty and should not be missed. There is a place to keep footwear near entrance of the temple so do not keep footwear's at shops which are near the temple.                 Near the exit/entry of temple there is a place where free herbal tea is given . Do have it , its very good. At the same place they sell herbal tea powder .

Shree_Mahakaleshwar_Temple,WriterTrouvailleWorld,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Tips for the first timers,"We visited this temple after a very long time. Things have quite changed here & for the good. The queue management system has improved a lot. Few tips for the first timers :1. Do not try to take your own 4-wheelers for visit. The temple lanes are pretty narrow & crowdy as well.2. Indian auto rickshaws are the best way to reach the temple. Walking is the fastest way if once you get stuck in the traffic near the temple.3. Be prepared to walk a lot. Parking is far away from temple. Even rented vehicle pick-up & drop point near the temple premises is a bit far & you have to walk a lot inside as well before reaching the main temple.4. Once you are inside, nobody is allowed to go near the shivlinga. You have to submit your offerings to the temple priest only.5. The behavior of the police/guards was pretty strict & rough. Duration of visit depends upon the crowd. You might not get more than a few seconds for darshan. Be mentally prepared for it.6. No electronics, leather items, etc. are allowed inside. Read the details at temple website.7. Try to take the left-side queue inside temple because when you reach the main area, that queue will give you a closer view of the shivlinga. Right-side queue get a good top view but they wont be able to submit offerings directly to the priest."

Anyone who goes in the main Jyotirling area needs to wear a dhoti and go there, the pandits arrange for that too, The temple complex is like a very well run machinery as it has lockers for mobile phones which are not allowed in the temple area, There is also a VIP darshan counter which charges you Rs. 250 for a fast Darshan, people in hurry should opt for this. The entire feel of the temple is of course divine, it‚Äôs calming too and after u are through with the Darshan u are happy and calm for a lot of time. For a true lord shiva devotee this is a must do.

So very well managed by the Trust, Prasad shops and Flowers shop etc are reasonable and they don't cheat you just bcoz u r a Bhakt/Tourist. There is predefined price for the kind of puja one want to offer to Lord Shiva. However this is as per individual's faith to hire a priest for puja or do darshan on his own. Female family members need to wear sari and male to wear dhoti for visiting the garbh grah for close darshan of Lord Mahakal, u can buy these or even rent them just outside the temple.Jai Mahakal!!!"

Shree_Mahakaleshwar_Temple,Abhi62001,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019,Jyothirlingam,"With great enthu we visited this temple. We had tickets for Bhasmarati but disappointed very much. we were told to stand in the queue at 1 am and we did so. at 4 am all devotees standing the queue were allowed to enter the temple. No facility of washrooms or food inside. The website instructs not to carry plastic or mobiles but so many people had phones with them. We became fools for not having carried mobiles. At  4.30 we entered the main temple where all the galleries were full and no place to sit. We couldn't perform abhisheka though we carried cups with us. Couldn't see bhasmarathi directly but we had satisfy ourselves by seeing relay in the TV. Some VIP along with shirts and pants entered the sanctum sanctorum did Abhishekam also. Though the temple is very good and worth visiting, we were dissatisfied because of the working style of the temple authority. Decoration done after all Bhasmathi was eye arresting. Wonderful decoration where lingam was looking so bright and devotees felt blessed. It is better to go for normal dharshan or special dharshan of Rs 250 instead of Bhasmarathi. Generally religious sites will be visited by aged people so washrooms and food and water facilities should be provided in the temple complex. "

Shree_Mahakaleshwar_Temple,Pavan,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Poorly managed Jalabhishek,"First of all, I would like to make it clear that the context of this review is about our experience  of Jalabhishek. While Bhasmarathi and the overall temple atmosphere is amazing, we had a terrible experience of Jalabhishek.The pujaris and the temple volunteers managing Jalabhishek handle the crowd extremely poorly that leaves a bad taste. In the sanctoram, the pujaris literally pull and push people, including the elderly and kids. This can have safety issues given that the place also gets slippery during this time. My 5 year old was handled poorly as she apparently did not completely meet their dressing standards. While I get that temples may have their rules, here they take it to the extent of forcefully physically handling even kids that can hurt, physically and mentally. My kid was terrified as multiple volunteers pulled her out of the queue. Elderly people were also getting pulled and pushed while entering the sanctoram.The folks were perhaps doing this due to the large crowd to manag and limited time to complete the jalabhishek. However, it is unacceptable how this pathetic treatment can literally hurt people.The temple authorities should seriously think of managing the jalabhishek better and treat people visiting here with respect.The bhasmarathi, on the other hand, was amazing.My recommendation is that if you are visiting with elderly folks or kids, skip jalabhishek and instead directly head to bhasmarathi."

By deeply involving in humming sounds of the temple‚Äôs AARTI & the DHOL-NAGADE one virtually gets united with the supreme ONE. Visiting MAHAKALESHWR means that you are offering water to HIM with devotion, which require devotees to enter the sanctum sanctorum with only Dhoti (undergarment can also be wore), tying of which is an art (one may see videos on YouTube, as you will require to be in Dhoti for at-least 4 hours) and reach temple by 4am for BHASHM AARTI.Otherwise also, one may plan to visit any other time.

A big temple reasonably maintained  despite the huge pilgrim rush. The one thing we admire about the temple is the meticulous way the rituals are conducted. The bhasma aarthi in the early morning is a must to be seen here. This Bhasma Aarhti dharshan is  paid one at a nominal rate. The devotees sit in long queues from midnight outside the temple. They are allowed into the temple by 4 AM and are allowed to take holy water in a vessel which they have to bring- a small copper vessel or a tumbler. They are allowed to do the abhishek themselves on Mahakaleshwar. A thrilling experience. Then the devotees are led to a big auditorium in front of the Main deity. By 6AM Mahakaeshwar ( the Lingam) is showerd with copious amount of Bhasmam. This and other harthis take place for about one hour. One has to experience this spectacle.The Bhasma Prasad relieves you from all sins.But note that, all the gents , including boy-kids have to wear dhoti as kachcham - a traditional way. Nobody is exempted.The holy water is from the holy tank in the temple.The Nav graha in the rear side of the temple is a wonderful place.
