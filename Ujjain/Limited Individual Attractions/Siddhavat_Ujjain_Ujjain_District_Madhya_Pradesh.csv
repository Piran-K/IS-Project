Siddhavat,Payal G,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2018 â€¢ Friends,Vikram Betaal,The temple is built around an ancient banyan tree that is said to the tree in the popular folklore of Vikram and Betaal. Ask the priest to tell the real story of Betaal which is totally different from the popular television and comic stories showing him hanging on King Vikramaditya's back asking him riddles (won't spoil the story).The tree is a wish tree with thousands of wish threads tied to it. Worship for ancestors is done on the ghat next to the tree.Another unique thing that must be noted on the left before entering the temple is the place of the record keepers. These books called Bahi-Khatas record information of visitors dating back centuries including family trees. Do check if known ancestors had visited the place (precise place of origin has to be mentioned as books are filed as per location and then caste and surname). This is an ancient way of maintaining records which is particularly helpful in keeping track of deaths and births before government certificates came about (the person showing us the books bragged about how even the Supreme Court accepts these as evidence ðŸ™„ðŸ¤”). Overall a different experience.
