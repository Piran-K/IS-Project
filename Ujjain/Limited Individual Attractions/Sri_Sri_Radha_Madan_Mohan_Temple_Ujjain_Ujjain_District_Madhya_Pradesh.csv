Sri_Sri_Radha_Madan_Mohan_Temple,Vikas Singh,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2015 • Solo,Madan Mohan temple,You will not find any reference to this temple on the internet. The references are more for the more advertised ISCKON temple. This temple situated right on the Ram Ghat is hardly visited. Built by Bayaji bai the temple houses the idol of Madan Mohan. The wooden beams and doors are intricately carved. It is a nice peaceful temple away from the hustle and bustle of the otherwise crowded temples of Ujjain
