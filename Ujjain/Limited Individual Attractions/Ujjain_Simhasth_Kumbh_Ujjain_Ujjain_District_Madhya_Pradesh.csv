Ujjain_Simhasth_Kumbh,Satveer S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2016 • Family,Must visit there,"As simhasth is held in every 12 years it's the best thing in Ujjain as Ujjain is famous for it too. It's must visit place but we have to wait for 12 years for simhasth. You must enjoy in simhasth and I assure that. There are so many babas, gurus and so on comes here on simhasth and so many motivation lactures, bhandaras held there and we must enjoy swimming in kshipra river which is the best river. So if any one visit in Ujjain during simhasth time than they must visit mangalnath too and kshipra side too. And there are so many big hotels here for resting and simhasth is for 1 months and there are some saahi isnans at which we must go for isnan at shipra and its really a prime time forever and it has been running for very long time. So everyone must visit here at simhasth and there are so many ashrams in ahead of shipra river so you must visit there to meet guru ji's and take ashirvad of them. I hope you find my review helpful and you must want to visit in Ujjain during simhast time too and you must visit Ujjain at other times to visit mahakaleswar temple, kshipra river and many others temples, gurdwaras, masjids and many hotels. There are two churches here too so you can visit there too and during Christmas time there is a rush there so you may visit here at that time too because there is a good celebration at that time."

Though we did not visit this place during that time, we definitely felt the vibration of this place when we visited.  The Kumb is on the holy Shipra river that flows though Ujjain.  When we visited there was not much facilities to take take bath and change, therefore we just opted to have water splashed on our heads and prayed to the Sun God.  If one is in Ujjain a holy dip is a must in the Shipra river as it is believed that it removes all sins committed by us.  The Ram Ghat is a comfortable place to take a holy dip."

It is done in love, or it is done in fear; I do not know which it is. No matter what the impulse is, the act born of it is beyond imagination, marvellous to our kind of people, the cold whites.”-- Mark Twain in 1895, after visiting the Kumbh Mela      "

Ujjain_Simhasth_Kumbh,Hemu J,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 • Couples,SimhasthKumbh 2016,"Where you can find a place on earth where millions people assemble to seek nirvana ? Certainly you need to head to Kumbh !2016 Kumbh is ongoing at Ujjain, the city of Mahakaal and is famously known as Simhasth Kumbh. You can see primarily rural India flocking with family and friends to take a dip in holy Shipra. Needless to say the entire brigade of Sadhus of different aakharas and maths claiming the first right to take holy dip !  You can essentially observe how insignificant we are as an individual when such a mass of people is at one place and this in itself is a nirvana moment. I was escorting a group of elders (all in age group of 60+ ) and planned the trip keeping their health in mind. We had booked our flights early from Delhi to Indore and from there we hired cab to reach Ujjain. We stayed in aakhara as we know someone there. As plan B I had aleady seen few hotels and they seemed to be quite good for stay of elders. We carried basic medicines along with what elders were already taking regularly. We carried sufficient clothes for 4 days. I prepared Identity Cards for elders stating name and contact numbers of family and friends so that if someone gets lost it is easy for elders to get united with family and friends. Also we had sufficient biscuits, light snacks and water bottles.  I also downloaded simhasthKumb app from Google Play and this is something I recommend to one and all those who are planning to visit SimhasthKumbh as it contains lot of useful information."

The bank is dotted with 12 Ghats (stairs), which can be used to reach out to the clean river water, which is continuously cleaned by the Ozone RO purifiers to maintain Hygiene. People from all over the country congregate, participate in religious discourses, meet the esteemed sages and seek their blessings apart from the visit to Mangalnath temple and Mahakal Temple. The city which has a population of 0.6 Millions gears up infrastructure to receive so many devotees , and the administration manages the event well. The city embraces you, energises you and you feel pure after the visit."

Ujjain_Simhasth_Kumbh,Yogesh2801,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 • Family,Simhast Kumbh at Ujjain,"Ujjain Simhastha is a Hindu religious mela held every 12 years in the Ujjain city of Madhya Pradesh, India. The name derives from the fact that it is held when the Jupiter is in Leo (Simha in Hindu astrology).It is one of the four fairs traditionally recognized as Kumbha Melas, and is also known as Ujjain Kumbh Mela.  According to Hindu mythology, drops of amrita (the drink of immortality) dropped at four places, while transporting it in a kumbha (pot). These four places, including Ujjain, are identified as the present-day sites of the Kumbh Mela."
Ujjain_Simhasth_Kumbh,mukulchand,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 • Solo,The Best of the Kumbhs,The Simhastha Mahakumbh was the fourth Kumbh I have attended. It was the best organized. I thoroughly soaked myself in the Religious Ambience. The Ghats were amazingly clean and it was a pleasure to take a dip in the River.
Ujjain_Simhasth_Kumbh,ominvent,4.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 • Family,A gathering of faith and belief.,"As many others have reviewed, the arrangement by the local administration is superb and calls for appreciation w.r.t people's security and traffic management. During ""Shahi Baths"" there will be restrictions for general public to have bath at particular times due to Sadhus taking a dip in river Shipra in groups. But otherwise it will not be much crowded at the ghats for taking bath. It will be a lifetime experience to witness such a religious gathering and being part of it. From accommodation and meal point of view, one needn't go for hotels which charge inflated amount during this period, instead one can look for ""Pandals"" or ""Vishramgrahs"" setup by many charitable trusts and saints of various regions mostly for free or few hundred bucks( yes both accommodation and meals). This will definitely not be of the level of hotels but surely is economical and safe too.Tips:1. If you wish to remain economical in your expenditure, then you can go to ""Peepli Naka"" area. There are many free/economical accommodation+meals provided by various religious trusts. Also this area is closer to bathing places called ""ghats"" and ""Mahakaleshwar temple"".2. This area is merely 3.5 km from Ujjain railway station. But remember, in the night, taxi drivers might refuse to go there due to traffic restriction by police. But ask them to drop to a nearby place, the remaining distance will surely be walk-able.3. Don't worry if you reach late in the night at Ujjain railway station because due to Kumbh this city is awake 24x7."

Ujjain_Simhasth_Kumbh,Narain S,5.0 of 5 bubbles,May 2016 • Friends,The biggest exhibition on the planet.,"The kumbha mela is a must visit event in anyone's life .I could bet there is no experience in this world which brings you close to god than the kumbha mela. One could see people from various parts of India coming here for the kumbh for its religious significance and foreigners come to witness such a marvel. The kumbh experience is spiritual as well as phsycadelic. It is a world completely isolated but yet connected to this world.One can easily find Naga sadhus in the streets and ghats . They roam naked, smearing holy ash over their body,chanting mantras and smoking ganja in their chillum. You may think that these guys are out of their minds doing all crazy stuff . You wouldn't know how rich they are in their knowledge about this world , their perspective about this world is entirely different from what you would have imagined. They live in a state of trance thinking only about Lord shiva. One can learn from their life that ""man who has nothing is the richest"".not anything in this world except lord shiva can ever fascinate a Naga sadhus.once after the kumbh is over they go back to their caves in Himalayas or wherever they came from only at the kumbh they can be seen inside the civilization.My experience in the kumbh was really 1000 times better than what I thought it would be . I thought it would be poorly organized but the Madhya pradesh government proved me wrong. It requires such a great amount of planning to organize such an event without any risks of stampedes or terrorist attacks. MUST DO THINGS AT THE KUMBH :*Vist the mahakaleshwar temple*Interact with people on their views of the kumbh mela *Share a chillum with some group smoking up. You would get stoned and go into deep conversation about questions of life .*Have a dip in Kshipra *eat local food *Drink Bhang near the mahakaleshwar temple shouting ""JAI HO MAHAKAL""one the whole the kumbh is a must Vist marvel . I am sure you would learn as well as enjoy a lot there . A life changing experience for sure . Will make you think 360° ..a 5/5 experience HAR HAR MAHADEV !!"
