Vikrant_Bhairav_Shrine,Hiten_Rathod,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nov 2017 • Family,"Rewind your childhood stories - Vikram & Vaital,",During my first visit to Ujjain made it a point to visit this place as heard and read many stories of famous Vikram and Vaital specially being a Gujarati.Visit to this place refreshed and rewound all those memoirs and felt alive.Though a small place but whoever has heard of Vikram and Vaital would definitely visit this place once if in Ujjain specially to familiarise our young generation of our legacy.Share the story of a shephard who used to sit on a sand mound and deliver judgements which used to be so perfect that people used to wonder how such a small boy could perform such acts? On digging the mound a maginificent throne with 32 dolls/fairies was unearthed............you have to take this forward friends.Enjoy.
