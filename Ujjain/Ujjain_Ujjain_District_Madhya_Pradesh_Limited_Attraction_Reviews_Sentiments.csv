Shree_Mahakaleshwar_Temple,Abhishek,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Aug 2022,Do Read If one has zero Idea of going to Ujjain Mahakaleswar...,"1) In any Trip, one of the most important thing required is stay. I would recommend people to use clock rooms at railway station to deposit luggage. The railway station is near to temple. Even in worst traffic one can reach by max 30min. Hotels like Satyug may charge 6K and above but are good in facility. Hotels like Dayal guest house may charge 3K and above but room is very much compact. Once the stay is fixed then one needs food2) Food facility is very high. Even near Sandipni Ashram one can go to restaurant...The entire thali buffet may cost around 200rs per person.3) After coming to ujjain i would suggest one to go to Ramghat and take bath in river. Be cautious as the river flow rises drastically...Within hours of my stay the river arose by 2-3 steps4)  After the bath, i would suggest to visit temple. But i would say visit in night. At-least one may see bhasm aarti around 22:30. During my visit some big person came to temple and hence the crowd was pushed outside the temple. Collector, joint collector, SP all vehicles were parked...5) By 23:00hrs you will be coming out of temple so do visit, bada ganapti...6) Sleep in night and next day one can go to places all over ujjain like harsidhi, nag-chandreswar temple, mangalnath, chintamani ganesh, gad kaali, kaal bhariva (one of the cutest god I have seen in my life)....Do feel the ambience of gad kaali and kaal bhairava...7) In the overall trip the only discouraging factor may be the long intentional queues/barricades created by govt..... which may lead in blocking of route to temple ( like we could not go to harsidhi as routes were blocked)....But over come this thinking as the only king of the the entire time is watching everything....",0.9489,5

Shree_Mahakaleshwar_Temple,sandeepk3362015,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jun 2022,Jai Mahakal,"I visited with my family during June, 2022. I had a wonderful experience there. A few tips for pilgrims:Regarding JAL Abhishek:1. Rules of temple change on daily basis. We visited on Saturday around 6:30 pm but temple authorities told us that JAL ABHISHEK timings are from 6 am to 4 pm. Then we visited next day (i.e. Sunday) around 12 (noon). Then we were told that JAL ABHISHEK will be allowed till 1 pm only. So rules change on daily basis. Be prepared for the same.2. You need to pay Rs 1500 for 2 persons but for single person, you need to pay Rs 1000. Children above 10 years are treated as Adult and they need a Ticket for JAL ABHISHEK. Till 10 years, children need not buy any ticket.3. All males (including small children) need to wear Dhoti for entering Garb Grah. Similarly, all females (incl small kids) need to wear saree for entering Garb Grah.4. Water and lota will be provided to you free-of-cost inside Garb Grah. Some people will try to cheat you by charging money for that. Do not fall pray to them.5. Earlier Tickets were sold outside Bada Ganesh ji's temple. But now, tickets are being sold outside Bharat Mata temple.6. You cannot carry anything like prasad or flowers to Garb Grah. Security personals will snatch the same from you.7. It is better to buy old dhoti and chola set from shops outside the temple. Else you will have to wait for other devotees to share dhoti with you after their puja. One set of dhoti/chola will cost you Rs 250. Shopkeepers will help you in wearing dhoti if you require.8. Always visit mandir of Sakshi Gopal ji after visiting Shree Mahakal ji to register your attendance.9. Visit Kal Bhairav temple after visiting this temple.Regarding VIP tickets:1. Each VIP ticket costs Rs 250 per person. 2. Benefit of VIP ticket is that you reduce time in waiting in queues. Also, you get an  opportunity to see Shri Mahakal ji from first 2 rows instead of rows from 3rd number and onwards.",0.9884,5

Shree_Mahakaleshwar_Temple,WriterTrouvailleWorld,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Dec 2019,Tips for the first timers,"We visited this temple after a very long time. Things have quite changed here & for the good. The queue management system has improved a lot. Few tips for the first timers :1. Do not try to take your own 4-wheelers for visit. The temple lanes are pretty narrow & crowdy as well.2. Indian auto rickshaws are the best way to reach the temple. Walking is the fastest way if once you get stuck in the traffic near the temple.3. Be prepared to walk a lot. Parking is far away from temple. Even rented vehicle pick-up & drop point near the temple premises is a bit far & you have to walk a lot inside as well before reaching the main temple.4. Once you are inside, nobody is allowed to go near the shivlinga. You have to submit your offerings to the temple priest only.5. The behavior of the police/guards was pretty strict & rough. Duration of visit depends upon the crowd. You might not get more than a few seconds for darshan. Be mentally prepared for it.6. No electronics, leather items, etc. are allowed inside. Read the details at temple website.7. Try to take the left-side queue inside temple because when you reach the main area, that queue will give you a closer view of the shivlinga. Right-side queue get a good top view but they wont be able to submit offerings directly to the priest.",0.8873,5

Anyone who goes in the main Jyotirling area needs to wear a dhoti and go there, the pandits arrange for that too, The temple complex is like a very well run machinery as it has lockers for mobile phones which are not allowed in the temple area, There is also a VIP darshan counter which charges you Rs. 250 for a fast Darshan, people in hurry should opt for this. The entire feel of the temple is of course divine, it‚Äôs calming too and after u are through with the Darshan u are happy and calm for a lot of time. For a true lord shiva devotee this is a must do.

Wonderful decoration where lingam was looking so bright and devotees felt blessed. It is better to go for normal dharshan or special dharshan of Rs 250 instead of Bhasmarathi.

While Bhasmarathi and the overall temple atmosphere is amazing, we had a terrible experience of Jalabhishek.The pujaris and the temple volunteers managing Jalabhishek handle the crowd extremely poorly that leaves a bad taste. In the sanctoram, the pujaris literally pull and push people, including the elderly and kids. This can have safety issues given that the place also gets slippery during this time. My 5 year old was handled poorly as she apparently did not completely meet their dressing standards. While I get that temples may have their rules, here they take it to the extent of forcefully physically handling even kids that can hurt, physically and mentally. My kid was terrified as multiple volunteers pulled her out of the queue. Elderly people were also getting pulled and pushed while entering the sanctoram.The folks were perhaps doing this due to the large crowd to manag and limited time to complete the jalabhishek. However, it is unacceptable how this pathetic treatment can literally hurt people.The temple authorities should seriously think of managing the jalabhishek better and treat people visiting here with respect.The bhasmarathi, on the other hand, was amazing.My recommendation is that if you are visiting with elderly folks or kids, skip jalabhishek and instead directly head to bhasmarathi.",-0.802,1

Certainly you need to head to Kumbh !2016 Kumbh is ongoing at Ujjain, the city of Mahakaal and is famously known as Simhasth Kumbh. You can see primarily rural India flocking with family and friends to take a dip in holy Shipra. Needless to say the entire brigade of Sadhus of different aakharas and maths claiming the first right to take holy dip !  You can essentially observe how insignificant we are as an individual when such a mass of people is at one place and this in itself is a nirvana moment. I was escorting a group of elders (all in age group of 60+ ) and planned the trip keeping their health in mind. We had booked our flights early from Delhi to Indore and from there we hired cab to reach Ujjain. We stayed in aakhara as we know someone there. As plan B I had aleady seen few hotels and they seemed to be quite good for stay of elders. We carried basic medicines along with what elders were already taking regularly. We carried sufficient clothes for 4 days. I prepared Identity Cards for elders stating name and contact numbers of family and friends so that if someone gets lost it is easy for elders to get united with family and friends. Also we had sufficient biscuits, light snacks and water bottles.

During ""Shahi Baths"" there will be restrictions for general public to have bath at particular times due to Sadhus taking a dip in river Shipra in groups. But otherwise it will not be much crowded at the ghats for taking bath. It will be a lifetime experience to witness such a religious gathering and being part of it. From accommodation and meal point of view, one needn't go for hotels which charge inflated amount during this period, instead one can look for ""Pandals"" or ""Vishramgrahs"" setup by many charitable trusts and saints of various regions mostly for free or few hundred bucks( yes both accommodation and meals). This will definitely not be of the level of hotels but surely is economical and safe too.Tips:1. If you wish to remain economical in your expenditure, then you can go to ""Peepli Naka"" area. There are many free/economical accommodation+meals provided by various religious trusts. Also this area is closer to bathing places called ""ghats"" and ""Mahakaleshwar temple"".2. This area is merely 3.5 km from Ujjain railway station. But remember, in the night, taxi drivers might refuse to go there due to traffic restriction by police. But ask them to drop to a nearby place, the remaining distance will surely be walk-able.3.

One could see people from various parts of India coming here for the kumbh for its religious significance and foreigners come to witness such a marvel. The kumbh experience is spiritual as well as phsycadelic. It is a world completely isolated but yet connected to this world.One can easily find Naga sadhus in the streets and ghats . They roam naked, smearing holy ash over their body,chanting mantras and smoking ganja in their chillum. You may think that these guys are out of their minds doing all crazy stuff . You wouldn't know how rich they are in their knowledge about this world , their perspective about this world is entirely different from what you would have imagined. They live in a state of trance thinking only about Lord shiva. One can learn from their life that ""man who has nothing is the richest"".not anything in this world except lord shiva can ever fascinate a Naga sadhus.once after the kumbh is over they go back to their caves in Himalayas or wherever they came from only at the kumbh they can be seen inside the civilization.My experience in the kumbh was really 1000 times better than what I thought it would be . I thought it would be poorly organized but the Madhya pradesh government proved me wrong. It requires such a great amount of planning to organize such an event without any risks of stampedes or terrorist attacks. MUST DO THINGS AT THE KUMBH :*Vist the mahakaleshwar temple*Interact with people on their views of the kumbh mela *Share a chillum with some group smoking up.

Bhartrihari_Caves,Gary M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Sep 2016 ‚Ä¢ Solo,A visit to the Bhartrihari caves of Ujjain,"I have been to this holy site on two occasions and had conversations with several Nath Yogis there, who were very generous in sharing stories about their life experiences.The Bhartrihari caves of Ujjain are situated on the eastern bank of Kshipra (Shipra) River, about 7 kilometres from Ujjain city. They are almost midway between the revered Maa Gadkalika Temple (600 metres) and Rinmukteshwar Mahadev Temple (400 metres). Named after the famous sage Bhartrihari, these caves are very popular with Hindu pilgrims and tourists alike. The Kshipra River passes close by, which adds to the natural beauty of the area.These caves are said to be where the philosopher-poet and former King Bhartrihari lived and meditated after renouncing his throne in favour of his younger brother, King Vikramaditya. Bhartrihari turned away from the material comforts of royal life and became an ascetic of the Nath Yogi sect on the advice of his Guru, Gorakshnath. It is believed that he did so because of a domestic intrigue involving his wife that caused him great despair and rendered him disgusted with the pleasures of this world.Gorakshnath was a renowned ascetic and founder of the Nath Yogi sect who instilled fearlessness in his devotees. He is revered all over Northern and Western India, and especially in Nepal where the famed and fearless Ghurkha soldiers honour him as their guiding light. Although Gorakshnath is traditionally regarded the foremost disciple of Matsyendranath ‚Äì claimed by Nath Yogis to be the first human Guru in their teaching succession ‚Äì Matsyendranath most probably preceded Gorakhnath by three centuries.Bhartrihari is remembered as a great scholar and renowned spiritual poet, known for his elegant Sanskrit prose, including Vairagyas‚Äôataka, Nitis‚Äôataka and Shringars‚Äôataka. His special predilection was towards the Hindu Trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. According to the commentaries of prominent 19th century Indologist, Kashinath Trimbak Telang (1850‚Äì1893), Bhartrihari flourished towards the end of the 1st and the beginning of the 2nd centuries of the Christian era.There is a holy shrine in one of the caves for visitors belonging to the Nath community with effigies of Matsyendranath, Gorakshnath and Bhartrihari. Every year, thousands of tourists and pilgrims visit the place, some out of curiosity and others to pay homage to these three great Yogis. Nath Yogis also camp in tents in the surrounding area and can be seen sitting around their ritual fires.Some of the passages in the caves are very narrow and there is smell of incense and burnt wood inside. Visitors are not restricted from entering, but those who suffer from claustrophobia will not feel comfortable inside. There are also ascetics who still live in nearby caves and carry out their spiritual practices. There are also several refreshment houses and restaurants in the surrounding area. So, whether you are a pilgrim or just a curious tourist, it‚Äôs a great place to visit.",0.9823,5

Kalidasa_Academy,Gary M,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Jan 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Kalidasa Akademi on University Road, Ujjain, is home to the Indian arts.","One of the more interesting places to visit in the Ujjain is the Kalidasa Academy on University Road, which was established by the Madhya Pradesh government in 1978 to honour the memory and works of Mahakavi Kalidasa, a great Indian poet and dramatist in the 4th Century B.C. Often described as the ‚ÄúShakespeare of India‚Äù, a recent discovery of an inscription in 1964 is said to establish that he was born in Ujjain (then Ujjayini) around the time of the famous King Chandragupta Vikramaditya. Although, Sanskrit scholar Lakshmi Dhar Kalla (1891-1953) concluded that Kalidasa was born in Kashmir. But don‚Äôt try telling that to anyone from Ujjain. Mahakavi Kalidasa‚Äôs famous quotes include:‚ÄúPlease subdue the anguish of your soul. Nobody is destined only to happiness or to pain. The wheel of life takes one up and down by turn.‚Äù‚ÄúToday well-lived makes every yesterday a dream of happiness.‚ÄùAccording to one popular story, Kalidasa was an uneducated man who, through good fortune, married a princess. Challenged by his wife to better himself, he took up the study of poetry and went on to become one of India‚Äôs legendary poets. Another story relates that, in the latter part of his life, he visited the king of Sri Lanka and, because of some treachery there, was murdered. Their website informs us that Kalidasa Academy was established with the following objectives:1)	Study and exploration of Kalidasa‚Äôs literature from both a literary and an academic point of view, and also from the interdisciplinary angles in terms of its total impact on the various forms;2)	Translation, preparation, publication and documentation of Kalidasa‚Äôs and other Sanskrit works in various world languages, with particular accent on preparing stage versions of Sanskrit plays in Hindi and other Indian languages;3)	Establishment of a model Sanskrit theatre (Natyamandap) as per the norms of Bharata‚Äôs Natya Shastra, with a view to attempt authentic reconstruction of the ancient style and to facilitate regular production of Kalidasa‚Äôs and other Sanskrit plays by eminent classical theatre personalities from all over the country as well as abroad.4)	Collection and analysis of all available material relating to Sanskrit theatre and those forms which are living remnants of the classical style;5)	Establishment of a museum of Sanskrit theatrical arts and a library of traditional music, theatre and dance costumes etc. and their documentation through tapes, films and other media, including production of books of Sanskrit plays and the like;6)	Facilities for imparting training in classical theatre and for undertaking research in related areas. The Academy complex consists of an indoor theatre, a museum, a library, a mini-stage for rehearsals, lecture and seminary halls, research facilities for scholars, and a large open-air theatre.I have visited Kalidasa Academy on many occasions to attend plays, art exhibitions, vocal and music recitals, classical dance performances and conferring ceremonies.

The flavours of different delicious dishes scented the air so much so that the appetites of the goddesses were appeased. They came to enjoy the food while the king hid himself below the table. On top of this table he had placed the replica of a man made of sweets. As the goddesses enjoyed the hearty meal and were about to leave, one of them happened to glance at the replica. She ate the replica and wondered aloud as to who could have kept it there. At that moment, Vikramaditya showed himself. The goddess asked him to express a wish. Vikramaditya requested that she should never cross to this side of the river. Pleased by his courage, she agreed.

A fragmented inscription recovered from this place records building of the palace in 1458 AD, by Sultan of Malwa, Mahmud Khilji. The palace is built over a mound and gives a beautiful view of the surrounding area. The central dome of the palace is a beautiful example of Persian architecture. There are several underground chambers some of which once served as royal kitchen.  Colonel Stewart records in his book ‚ÄúHistory of Central India‚Äù that later Sultan Naseeruddin Khilji diverted the flow of Shipra River through 52 tanks so that water cooled down considerably. Addicted to mercury, the Sultan used to lie down intoxicated in the tanks. He is later believed to have drowned in one of these tanks while lying down intoxicated. Two Persian inscriptions found in one of the long corridors of the palace record the visits of Emperor Akbar and Jahangir to this palace According to Abul Fazal‚Äôs Akbarnama, Mughal emperor Akbar rested at this the palace on 25 Jan, 1599 during his Deccan military campaign. Later in 1616, Jahangir stayed with Sir Thomas Roe in this palace. During his stay here, Jahangir used to visit regularly saint Jadrup who had his hut in the jungles nearby. He used to travel by boat to listen to holy discourses.The palace was destroyed in the time of the Pindaris. In 1886 Sir Michale Filose partially restored the palace and used it as his residence. After his death the palace again fell into ruins. It was then restored by Madhav Rao Scindia in 1920. He added many buildings such as the court, guest house and other state offices.
